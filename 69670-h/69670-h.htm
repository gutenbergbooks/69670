<p>We have so often agreed that causes are more
interesting than the most dramatic results, that I feel you
are the right person to receive the dedication of my story
about Elsie Palmer, in which I have tried to reconstruct
the psychological developments that led, by inexorable
degrees, to the catastrophe of murder. These things are
never “bolts from the blue” in reality, but merely sensational
accessories to the real issue, which lies on that more
subtle plane of thought where only personalities are deserving
of dissection.</p>

<p>For what it is worth, I offer you an impression of Elsie
Palmer’s personality.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Elsie</span>, I’ve told you before, I won’t have you going with
boys.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do. And don’t contradict. Surely to goodness
you’re aware by this time that it’s the heighth of bad
manners to contradict. I’ve taken trouble enough to try
and make a lady of you, I’m sure, and now all you can do is
to contradict your mother, and spend your time walking
the streets with boys.”</p>

<p>“Mother, I never.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t tell lies about it, Elsie. Mother knows
perfectly well when you’re telling a lie, and you don’t take
her in by crocodile tears either, my lady. Don’t let me
have to speak to you again about the same thing, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>Elsie began to cry, automatically and without conviction.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do, miss. I mean Johnnie Osborne, and
Johnnie Osborne’s brother, and Stanley Begg and the rest
of them. Now, no more of it, Elsie. Go and give the gurl
a hand with washing up the tea-things, and hurry up.”</p>

<p>Elsie went away, glad that it was so soon over. Sometimes
mother went on for ages. Thank the Lord she was
busy to-day, with two new paying guests coming in. As
she went past the drawing-room door Elsie looked in.</p>

<p>“Hallo, little girl!”</p>

<p>“Hallo, Mr. Roberts! Can’t stay, I’ve to go and help
the girl wash up or something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“You’ve been crying!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t, then!” She went further into the room and
let him see the downward droop of her pouting mouth and
her wet eyelashes. She had not cried hard enough to make
her nose turn red.</p>

<p>“I say, what a shame! What have they been doing to
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. Mother’s on the warpath, that’s all.
It isn’t anything.”</p>

<p>“How rotten of her! Fancy scolding you! I thought
you were always good, Elsie.”</p>

<p>“And who said you might call me Elsie, if you’ll kindly
answer me that, Mister Impertinence?”</p>

<p>She shook her short, bobbing curls at him and laughed,
suddenly good-tempered.</p>

<p>“You witch! Elsie, shall you miss me a tiny bit when
I’m gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re going, are you?” She pretended to consider.
“Let me see, there’s a single gentleman coming,
who’ll have your room, and a married lady and gentleman
for the front bedroom. I don’t really suppose, Mr. Roberts,
there’ll be time to miss you much, with the house full like
that.” She looked innocently up at him.</p>

<p>“Little devil!” he muttered between his teeth, causing
her to thrill slightly, although she maintained her pose of
artlessness without a visible tremor.</p>

<p>“Who’s the bounder who’s going to have my room after
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Mis-ter Roberts!” She affected a high key of indignation.
“He isn’t a bounder. You know very well that
mother’s awfully particular. She wouldn’t take anyone
without he was a perfect gentleman in <i>every</i> way. Now I
can’t wait another minute. I should get into an awful
row if mother caught me here.”</p>

<p>“What’s the harm? Don’t run away, Elsie. Just
tell me this: are you coming to the pictures to-night—for
the last evening?”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you going to take me and Geraldine? I don’t
suppose Geraldine’ll be able to—she’s ill.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go without her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Mother wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here, Elsie—come without telling anyone.
Do, just for the lark. I swear I’ll take the greatest care of
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how could I? Besides, mother’d want to know
where I was.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you say you’re going somewhere with that
eternal friend of yours—that Irene Tidmarsh girl, or whatever
her name is?”</p>

<p>“I’ll thank you to remember you’re speaking of a friend
of mine, Mr. Roberts. And the idea of suggesting I should
do such a thing as deceive my mother! Why, I’m surprised
at you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t rot, Elsie. Say you’ll come. Slip out after
supper, and meet me at the bottom of the road. There’s
a jolly good programme on at the Palatial.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll enjoy the pictures, Mr. Roberts,” said
Elsie demurely. She sidled backwards to the door.</p>

<p>“I shall wait for you—eight o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p>“Don’t catch cold waiting,” she mocked.</p>

<p>“Look here, kid——”</p>

<p>“That’s mother! She’ll skin me alive, if I give her half
a chance!” She flew out into the hall and down the passage
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The servant Nellie was there, and Elsie’s sister Geraldine.</p>

<p>“Where’ve you been, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“With mother. I didn’t know you were here; I
thought you were s’posed to be ill.”</p>

<p>“So I am ill,” returned Geraldine bitterly. “But as
you were out, <i>someone</i> had to do some work.”</p>

<p>Elsie looked critically at her sister. Geraldine did look
ill, sallow and with black rims round her eyes, but then she
had something altogether wrong with her digestion, and
often looked like that.</p>

<p>“Bilious again?”</p>

<p>“’M. I think it was that beastly pudding we had last
night. I’ve been awfully sick.”</p>

<p>“Poor wretch!”</p>

<p>Neither of them paid any attention to Nellie Simmons,
who went on plunging and clattering greasy spoons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
plates about in the water that steamed from a chipped
enamel basin.</p>

<p>“Can’t you take this rag, Elsie, and wipe a bit, and let
me get upstairs? I’m sure I’m going to be sick again.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I must, then—poor me!”</p>

<p>“Poor you, when you’ve been out since dinner! I should
like to know what for. If it was me, now——Oh, Lord,
my head!”</p>

<p>“Well, go on upstairs again. Have you tried the new
medicine that Ireen’s aunt did the testimonial for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I don’t believe it’s a bit better than any of
the others. I feel like nothing on earth. I say, where
were you all the afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Curiosity killed the cat,” said Elsie, wiping the plates.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t want to know.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right then, we’re both satisfied, because I
don’t mean to tell you.”</p>

<p>Geraldine looked angrily at her sister and walked away,
her thin plait of dark hair flapping limply between her
angular, slouching shoulders.</p>

<p>“What is there for supper to-night, Nellie?” said Elsie
presently.</p>

<p>“The ’am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness, that old ham! Why can’t we ever have
anything <i>nice</i>, I should like to know! And I s’pose the cold
tart’s got to be finished up, and that beastly cold shape?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Nellie said laconically.</p>

<p>“Well, there’ll be no cooking to do, that’s one thing.”</p>

<p>“<i>She</i> wants some soup put on, because of the new people,
but I’ve left it all ready. I’m off at six sharp, I can tell
you.”</p>

<p>“What’s the hurry, Nellie?” asked Elsie amicably.
She saw that Nellie wanted to be asked, and she felt good-humoured
because there was no cooking to be done, and
she could lay the supper and ring the bell earlier than usual,
so as to be able to keep her appointment with Mr. Roberts.</p>

<p>“I’ve got someone waiting for me, I ’ave,” Nellie said
importantly. “Couldn’t be kept waiting—oh dear, no!”</p>

<p>Elsie looked at the ugly, white-faced Cockney woman,
whose teeth projected, decayed and broken, and round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
corners of whose mouth and nostrils clung clusters of dry
pimples, and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“It’s true!” said Nellie, offended. “And I’m off now.”</p>

<p>She went to dry her chapped hands on the limp and dingy
roller-towel that hung beside the cold-water tap.</p>

<p>Elsie laughed again, partly to tease Nellie Simmons and
partly because it really amused her to think that her own
projected diversion with Mr. Roberts should be parodied by
this grotesque Nellie and some unknown, equally grotesque,
companion.</p>

<p>Nellie pulled down her hat and coat from the peg on the
kitchen door, put them on and went away, although it was
quarter of an hour before her time. She knew well enough
that none of them would say anything, Elsie reflected.
Girls were too difficult to get hold of, when one took in
guests.</p>

<p>As soon as the side door had slammed behind Nellie,
Elsie flew into the scullery. A broken piece of looking-glass
hung there, where she had nailed it up herself long
ago.</p>

<p>She pulled down the thick, dust-coloured wave of hair
that fell from a boyish, left-hand parting, until it lay further
across her forehead, deepening the natural kink in it with
her fingers, and loosening the black ribbon bow that fell
over one ear. The soft, flopping curls fell to her shoulders
on either side of her full, childish face. She rubbed hard
at her cheeks for a moment, without producing very much
visible effect on their uniform pale pinkiness, starred all over
with tiny golden freckles. The gold was repeated in her
eyelashes and pale eyebrows, but Elsie’s eyes, to her eternal
regret, were neither blue nor brown. They were something
between a dark grey and a light green, and the clear blue
whites of them showed for a space between the iris and the
lower lid.</p>

<p>Her nose was straight and short; her wide mouth,
habitually pouting, possessed a very full underlip and a
short, curving upper one. When she showed her teeth, they
were white and even, but rather far apart. The most
salient characteristic of her face was that its high cheek-bones,
and well-rounded cheeks, gave an odd impression of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
pushing against her underlids, so that her eyes very often
looked half shut, and small. Elsie saw this in herself, and
it made her furious. She called it “a Japanese doll
look.”</p>

<p>She realised that her soft, rounded neck was really
beautiful, and was secretly proud of the opulent curves of
her figure; but to other girls she pretended that she
thought herself too fat, although in point of fact she wore
no stays.</p>

<p>She thought with pride that she looked more like eighteen
than sixteen years old, although she was not, and knew that
she never would be, very tall.</p>

<p>Dragging a black velveteen tam-o’-shanter from her
pocket, Elsie pulled it rakishly on over her curls, her fingers
quickly and skilfully pouching the worn material so that it
sagged over to one side. The hands with which she manipulated
the tam-o’-shanter were freckled too, like her face,
and of the same uniform soft pink. The fingers were short,
planted very far apart, and broad at the base and inclining
to curve backwards.</p>

<p>She wiped them on the roller-towel, as Nellie Simmons had
done, only far more hurriedly, and then went quietly out
at the side door. It opened straight into a small blind
alley, and Elsie ran up it, and into the road at a corner
of which her home was situated. Turning her back on
No. 15, from which she had just emerged, she kept on the
same side of the road, hoping to escape observation even
if Mrs. Palmer were to look out of the window.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, she was obliged to cross the road,
and then she rang the bell of a tall house that was the
counterpart of the one she lived in, and indeed of all the
other hundred and eighty yellow-and-red brick houses in
Hillbourne Terrace.</p>

<p>Irene Tidmarsh opened the door, a lanky, big-eyed
creature, with two prominent front teeth and an immense
plait of ugly brown hair. Her arms and legs were thick and
shapeless.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Elsie!”</p>

<p>“Hallo, Ireen. Look here, I can’t stay. I only want
to ask you if you’ll swear we’ve been to the pictures together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
to-night, if anyone ever asks. Quick! Be a sport, and
promise.”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” Irene asked wearily.</p>

<p>“Oh, only my fun. I don’t particularly want mother to
know about me going out to-night, that’s all. If I can
say I was with you if I’m asked, it’ll be all right, only
you’ll have to back me up if she doesn’t believe me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, I don’t care. You’re a caution, Elsie
Palmer—you and your made-up tales. Don’t see much
difference between them and downright lies, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what am I to do? I can’t ever go anywhere, or
have any amusement, without mother and Geraldine wanting
to know all about it, and if I’ve been behaving myself,
and ’cetera and ’cetera.”</p>

<p>“Who is it this time, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“Only this fellow who’s leaving to-morrow, the one
that’s been P.G. with us such a time, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Roberts?”</p>

<p>“’M. Well, so long, dear. Thanks awfully and all
that. Ta-ta. Don’t forget.”</p>

<p>“Ta-ta,” repeated Irene. “You’ll have to tell me all
about it on Sunday, mind.”</p>

<p>“Awright.”</p>

<p>Elsie turned and hurried homeward again, shrugging her
shoulders up to her ears as the wind whistled shrilly down
the street.</p>

<p>It was September, and cold.</p>

<p>When she was indoors again, she pulled off her tam-o’-shanter
and stuffed it once more into the pocket of her
serge skirt. Then she went upstairs to the room at the
top of the house that she shared with Geraldine.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d knock.”</p>

<p>“Whatever for? It’s my room as much as yours, isn’t
it?” Elsie said without acrimony.</p>

<p>“Have you been washing up all this time?”</p>

<p>“Nellie went off early.”</p>

<p>“The slut! Whatever for? Did you tell mother?”</p>

<p>“No. It wouldn’t be a bit of good. She won’t say
anything to Nellie just now, whatever she does, with these
new people just coming in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Oh, my head!” groaned Geraldine, not attending.</p>

<p>She lay on her bed, her white blouse crumpled, and a
machine-made knitted coat, of shrimp-pink wool, drawn
untidily over her shoulders. Her black Oxford shoes lay
on the mat between the two beds, and her black stockings
showed long darns and a hole in either heel.</p>

<p>Elsie began to arrange her hair before the looking-glass
in a painted deal frame that stood on the deal chest-of-drawers.
Presently she pulled a little paper bag from one
of the drawers and began to suck sweets.</p>

<p>“No good offering you any, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk of such a thing. Elsie, I can’t come down
to supper to-night. Do be a dear and bring me up a cup
of tea—nice and strong. I’ve got a sort of craving for hot
tea when I’m like this, really I have.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want much, do you, asking me to carry tea
up four flights of stairs? I’ll see what I can do.” Elsie
began to hum, in a small, rather tuneful little voice. She
let her skirt fall round her feet as she sang and pulled off her
blouse, revealing beautifully modelled breasts and shoulders.
Her arms were a little too short, but the line from breast-bone
to knee was unusually good, the legs plump and shapely,
with slender ankles and the instep well arched. She wore
serge knickerbockers and a flimsy under-bodice of yellow
cotton voile over a thick cotton chemise.</p>

<p>“Are you going out <i>again</i>?” asked Geraldine in a
vexed, feeble voice.</p>

<p>“I may go round and sit with Ireen for a bit, after supper.
I think she wants to go to the pictures, or something.”</p>

<p>“How’s Mr. Tidmarsh?”</p>

<p>“Going to die, I should think, by all accounts,” glibly
replied Elsie, although as a matter of fact she had forgotten
to make any enquiry for Irene’s father, who had for
months past been dying from some obscure and painful
internal growth.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he go to a hospital?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me. Ireen’s always begging him to, but
he won’t.”</p>

<p>“Old people are awfully selfish, I think,” said Geraldine
thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Yes, aren’t they? Look, I’m going to put this
collar on my Sunday serge. That ought to smarten it up
a bit.”</p>

<p>She pinned the cheap lace round the low-cut V at the
neck of an old navy-blue dress, and fastened it with a blue-stoned
brooch in the shape of a circle. Her throat rose up,
fresh and warm and youthful, from the new adornment.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it time I put my hair up, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“No. You’re only a kid. I didn’t put mine up till I
was eighteen. Mother wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>Elsie dragged a thick grey pilot-cloth coat from behind
the curtain of faded red rep that hung across a row of pegs
and constituted the sisters’ wardrobe, caught up the black
tam-o’-shanter again and ran downstairs.</p>

<p>All the time that she was laying the table in the dining-room,
which was next to the kitchen on the ground floor,
Elsie hummed to herself.</p>

<p>The tablecloth was stained in several places, and she
arranged the Britannia-metal forks and spoons, the coarse,
heavy plates and the red glass water-jug so as to cover the
spots as much as possible. In the middle of the table
stood a thick fluted green glass with paper chrysanthemums
in it.</p>

<p>Elsie added the cruet, two half-loaves of bread on a
wooden platter with “Bread” carved upon it in raised
letters, and put a small red glass beside each plate. Finally
she quickly pleated half a dozen coloured squares of
Japanese paper, and stuck one into each glass.</p>

<p>“Mother!” she called.</p>

<p>“What?” said Mrs. Palmer from the kitchen.</p>

<p>“It’s ready laid.”</p>

<p>“What are you in such a hurry for? Miss M. and Mr.
Williams haven’t turned up yet.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Roberts wants his supper early, I know.”</p>

<p>“You’ve no business to know, then. Well, put the ham
on the table and the cold sweets, and he can go in when he
pleases. This is Liberty Hall, as I call it.”</p>

<p>Elsie carried in the ham, placing the dish on the table
beside the carving-knife and fork that were raised upon a
“rest” of electro plate. The glass dishes containing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
flabby pink decoction of cornflour, and the apple tart, with
several slices of pastry gone from the crust, she laid at the
other end of the table.</p>

<p>“Supper’s in, Mr. Roberts,” she cried through the open
door of the drawing-room, but this time she did not go in,
and flew back to the kitchen before Mr. Roberts appeared.</p>

<p>“Geraldine’s asking for tea, mother.”</p>

<p>“There’s a kettle on. She can come and fetch it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it up,” Elsie volunteered.</p>

<p>“You’re very obliging, all of a sudden. I’m sure I
only wish you and your sister were more <i>like</i> sisters, the
way Aunt Ada and Aunt Gertie and Mother were. There
wasn’t any of this bickering between us girls that I hear
between you and Geraldine.”</p>

<p>“You’ve made up for it later, then,” said Elsie pertly.
“The aunts never come here but they find fault with things,
and Aunt Ada cries, and I’m sure you and Aunt Gertie
go at it hammer and tongs.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to speak to me like that, Elsie Palmer,”
said her mother abstractedly. (“Give me a spoon, there’s
a good gurl.”) “What you gurls are coming to, talking so
to your own mother, is more than I can say. What’s at
the bottom of all this talk about carrying tea to Geraldine?
What are you going to do about your own supper?”</p>

<p>“Have it in here. I don’t want much, anyway. I’m
not hungry. Tea and bread-and-jam’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Please yourself,” said Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>She was a large, shapeless woman, slatternly and without
method, chronically aggrieved because she was a widow with
two daughters, obliged to support herself and them by
receiving boarders, whom she always spoke of as guests.</p>

<p>“Where are these what-you-may-call-’ems—these
Williamses—coming from?” Elsie asked, while she was
jerking tea from the bottom of a cocoa-tin into a broken
earthenware tea-pot.</p>

<p>“Ask me no questions and I’ll tell you no lies,” said her
mother.</p>

<p>She had no slightest reason to conceal the little she knew
of the new people who were coming, but it was her habit
to reply more or less in this fashion, semi-snubbing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
semi-facetious, whenever either of her daughters asked a
question.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t want to know,” said Elsie, also from
habit.</p>

<p>She made the tea, poured out two cups-full and took one
upstairs. As she had expected, the alarm clock on the wash-stand
showed it to be eight o’clock.</p>

<p>Almost directly afterwards, she heard the front door slam.</p>

<p>No. 15 was a narrow, high house, with very steep stairs,
but Elsie was used to them, although she grumbled at the
number of times she went up and down them, and she and
Geraldine and Mrs. Palmer all kept numerous articles of
toilet and clothing in the kitchen, so as to save journeys
backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>She now went down once more, and sitting at a corner of
the newspaper-covered kitchen table, drank tea and ate
bread-and-jam deliberately.</p>

<p>“That’s the bell!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer hoisted herself out of her chair, from which
she had been reading the headlines of an illustrated daily
paper, commenting on them half aloud with: “Fancy!...
Whatever is the world coming to, is what I say....”</p>

<p>“That’ll be the Williamses, and about time too. You’ll
have to give me a hand upstairs with the boxes afterwards,
Elsie, but I’ll give ’em supper first.”</p>

<p>She went out into the hall, and Elsie heard the sounds of
arrival, and her mother’s voice saying: “Good evening,
you’ve brought us some wet weather, I’m afraid.... You
mustn’t mind me joking, Mrs. Williams, it’s my way....
Liberty Hall, you’ll find this....”</p>

<p>Elsie ran to the back kitchen, donned the pilot-cloth
coat and the tam-o’-shanter, and slipped out through the
side door into the wet drizzle of a cold autumn evening.</p>

<p>“Ooh!” She turned up the collar of the coat, and
pushed her gloveless bands deep into her pockets as she
hurried along the pavement. It shone wet and dark,
giving blurred reflections of the lamps overhead. Every
now and then a tram jerked and clanged its way along
the broad suburban road.</p>

<p>Only a few shops were lit along the road. Most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
buildings on either side were houses that displayed a brass
sign-plate on the door, or a card with “Apartments” in
one of the windows. Right at the end of the street, a
blur of bluish light streamed out from the Palatial Picture
House.</p>

<p>“I thought you weren’t coming,” said young Roberts,
reproachfully. “It’s long after eight.” He wore a light
overcoat and he, also, had turned up his collar as a protection
against the rain.</p>

<p>“I had to help mother, of course. And if you want to
know, I ought to be there now.” She laughed up at him
provocatively.</p>

<p>“Come on in,” he said, pulling her hand through his arm.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h4>II</h4>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was Elsie’s real life.</p>

<p>Although quite incapable of formulating the thought to
herself, she already knew instinctively that only in her
relations with some man could she find self-expression.</p>

<p>In the course of the past two years she had gradually
discovered that she possessed a power over men that other
girls either did not possess at all, or in a very much lesser
degree. From the exercise of unconscious magnetism, she
had by imperceptible degrees passed to a breathless, intermittent
exploitation of her own attractiveness.</p>

<p>She did not know why boys so often wished to kiss her,
nor why she was sometimes followed, or spoken to, in the
street, by men. At first she had thought that she must be
growing prettier, but her personal preference was for dark
eyes, a bright colour, and a slim, tall figure, and she honestly
did not admire her own appearance. Moreover, her looks
varied almost from day to day, and very often she seemed
plain. She had never received any instruction in questions
of sex, excepting whispered mis-information from
girls at school as to the origin of babies. The signs of
physical development that had come to her early were
either not commented upon except in half-disgusted, half-facetious
innuendo from Geraldine, or else dismissed by
Mrs. Palmer curtly:</p>

<p>“Nice gurls don’t think about those things. I’m ashamed
of you, Elsie. You should try and be nice-minded, as
mother’s always told her gurls.”</p>

<p>A sort of garbled knowledge came to her after a time,
knowledge that comprised the actual crude facts as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
physical union between men and women, and explained
in part certain violent bodily reactions to which she had
been prone almost since childhood.</p>

<p>She had not the least idea whether any other girl in the
world ever felt as she did, and was inclined to believe
herself unnatural and depraved.</p>

<p>This thought hardly ever depressed her. She thought
that to remain technically “a good girl” was all that was
required of her, and admitted no further responsibility.</p>

<p>Geraldine and she quarrelled incessantly. Geraldine,
with her poor physique and constant indispositions, was
angrily jealous of Elsie’s superb health and uninterrupted
preoccupation with her own affairs. She had only just
begun to suspect that Elsie was never without a masculine
admirer, and the knowledge, when it became a certainty,
would embitter the relations between them still further on
Geraldine’s side.</p>

<p>On Elsie’s side there was no bitterness, only contempt
and unmalicious hostility. She disliked her elder sister,
but was incapable of the mental effort implied by hatred.
In the same way, she disliked her mother, almost without
knowing that she did so.</p>

<p>Her home had always been ugly, sordid, and abounding
in passionless discord. Elsie’s real life, which was just
beginning to give her the romance and excitement for
which she craved, was lived entirely outside the walls of
No. 15, Hillbourne Terrace.</p>

<p>To-night, as she entered the hot, dark, enervating atmosphere
of the cinema theatre, she thrilled in response to the
contrast with the street outside. When she heard the
loud, emphasised rhythm of a waltz coming from the piano
beneath the screen, little shivers of joy ran through her.</p>

<p>A girl with a tiny electric torch indicated to them a row
of seats, and Elsie pushed her way along until the two
empty places at the very end of the row were reached.
It added the last drop to her cup of satisfaction that she
should have only the wall on one side of her. Human
proximity almost always roused her to a vague curiosity
and consciousness, that would have interfered with her full
enjoyment of the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>She settled herself in the soft, comfortable seat, slipping
her arms from the sleeves of her coat, and leaning back
against it.</p>

<p>Roberts dropped a small box into her lap as he sat down
beside her.</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully,” she whispered.</p>

<p>A film was showing, and Elsie became absorbed at once
in the presentment of it, although she had no idea of the
story. It came to an end very soon, and a Topical Budget
was shown. Elsie was less interested, and pulled the string
off her box of chocolates.</p>

<p>“Have one?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind. Thanks.”</p>

<p>“They’re awfully good.” She chewed and sucked blissfully.</p>

<p>“Ooh! Look at that ship! Isn’t it funny?”</p>

<p>“Makes you feel seasick to look at it, doesn’t it?”
whispered Roberts, and she giggled ecstatically.</p>

<p>Words appeared on the screen.</p>

<p>“‘Hearts and Crowns,’ featuring Lallie Carmichael.”</p>

<p>“How lovely!” said Elsie.</p>

<p>The story was complicated, and as most of the characters
were Russian, Elsie did not always remember whether Sergius
was the villain or the lawyer, and if Olga was the name of
the “vampire” or of the soubrette. But the beautiful
Lallie Carmichael was the heroine, and a clean-shaven
American the hero. Elsie watched them almost breathlessly,
and after a time it was she herself who was leaning
back in the crowded restaurant, in a very low dress, and
waving an ostrich-feather fan, torn between passion and
loyalty. The American hero assumed no definite personality,
other than that which his creator had endowed him.
The scenes that she liked best were those between the two
lovers, when they were shown alone together, and the
American made passionate love to the princess.</p>

<p>At the end of the First Part, the lights went up.</p>

<p>Elsie turned her shining eyes and rumpled curls towards
her escort.</p>

<p>“It is good, isn’t it?” he said, with a critical air.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it good? Have another sweet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Well, thanks, I don’t mind. Are you enjoying yourself,
kiddie?”</p>

<p>“Awfully. I like pictures.”</p>

<p>“What about me? Don’t you like me a little bit too,
Elsie, for bringing you?” His voice had become low and
husky.</p>

<p>Still under the emotional influence of the story, the music,
and the relaxation produced by bodily warmth and comfort,
she looked at him, and saw, not the common, rather negligible
features of sandy-haired Mr. Roberts, but the bold,
handsome American hero of the film.</p>

<p>“Of course I like you,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“You won’t forget me when I’ve gone?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You will, Elsie! You’ll let some other fellow take you
to the pictures, and you won’t give me another thought.”</p>

<p>“Of course I shall, you silly! I shall always remember
you—you’ve been awfully sweet to me.”</p>

<p>“Will you write to me?”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that.”</p>

<p>“Promise.”</p>

<p>“Promises are like pie-crusts, made to be broken.”</p>

<p>“Yours wouldn’t be. I bet anything if you promised a
chap something, you’d stick to it. Now wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I daresay I should,” she murmured, flattered. “Mother
says I’ve always been a terrible one for keeping to what
I’ve once said. It’s the way I am, you know.”</p>

<p>No fleeting suspicion crossed her mind that this was
anything but a true description of herself.</p>

<p>“Elsie, do you know what I should like to do?”</p>

<p>“What, Mr. Roberts?”</p>

<p>“Call me Norman. I should like to make a hell of a
lot of money and come back and marry you.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t use those words.”</p>

<p>“I’m in earnest, Elsie.”</p>

<p>“You’re making very free with my name, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“No,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“You’re a little darling.”</p>

<p>The lights went out again, and his hand fumbled for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
hers in the darkness. Warm and unresisting it lay in his,
and presently returned pressure for pressure.</p>

<p>The story on the screen began to threaten tragedy, and
Elsie’s body became tense with anxiety. She pressed her
shoulder hard against that of Roberts.</p>

<p>He, too, leant towards her, and presently slipped one
arm round her waist. Instantly her senses were awake,
and although she continued to gaze at the screen, she was
in reality blissfully preoccupied only with his embrace, and
the sensations it aroused in her.</p>

<p>Intensely desirous that he should not move away, she
relaxed her figure more and more, letting her head rest at
last against his shoulder. She began to wonder whether he
would kiss her, and to feel that she wanted him to do so.
As though she had communicated the thought to him, the
man beside her in the obscurity put his disengaged hand
under her chin and tilted her face to his.</p>

<p>She did not resist, and he kissed her, first on her soft
cheek and then on her mouth.</p>

<p>Elsie had been kissed before, roughly and teasingly by
boys, and once or twice, furtively, by an elderly lodger of
Mrs. Palmer’s, whose breath had smelt of whisky.</p>

<p>But the kisses of this young commercial traveller were of
an entirely different quality to these, and the pleasure that
she took in them was new and startling to herself.</p>

<p>“Elsie, d’you love me?” he whispered. “I love you.
I think you’re the sweetest little girl in the whole world.”</p>

<p>Elsie liked the words vaguely, but she did not really want
him to talk, she wanted him to go on kissing her.</p>

<p>“Say—‘I love you, Norman.’”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>“You must. Why won’t you?”</p>

<p>“It’s so soppy.”</p>

<p>“Elsie!”</p>

<p>She felt that the magnetic current between them had
been disturbed, and made an instinctive, nestling movement
against him.</p>

<p>He kissed her again, two or three times.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Elsie forced herself to the realisation that
the film must soon come to an end, and the lights reappear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
She looked at the screen again, and when the lovers, in
magnified presentment, exchanged a long embrace, responsive
vibrations shook her, and she felt all the elation of
conscious and recent initiation.</p>

<p>The lights suddenly flashed out, a moment sooner than
she expected them, and she flung herself across into her
own seat, pressing the backs of her hands against her
flushed, burning cheeks and dazzled eyes.</p>

<p>She knew that Norman Roberts was looking at her, but
she would not turn her head and meet his eyes, partly from
shyness, and partly from coquetry.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this the end?” she said, knowing that it was not,
but speaking in order to relieve her sense of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t over till half-past ten; there’s another forty
minutes yet.” He consulted his wrist-watch elaborately.
“I expect they’ll have a comic to finish up with.”</p>

<p>Elsie sensed constraint in him, too, and in sudden alarm
turned and faced him. As their eyes met, both of them
smiled and flushed, and Roberts slipped his arm under hers
and possessed himself of her hand again.</p>

<p>“Did you like that?” he whispered, bending towards
her.</p>

<p>“The picture?”</p>

<p>“You know I don’t mean that.”</p>

<p>She laughed and then nodded.</p>

<p>“Elsie, tell me something truly. Has any other fellow
ever kissed you?”</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to lie glibly. Then her natural,
instinctive understanding of the game on which they were
engaged, made her laugh teasingly.</p>

<p>“That’s telling, Mr. Inquisitive.”</p>

<p>“That means they have. I must say, Elsie, that considering
you’re only sixteen, I don’t call that very nice.”</p>

<p>Elsie snatched away her hand. “I get quite enough of
that sort of thing at home, thank you, Mr. Norman Roberts,
<i>Es</i>quire. There’s no call for you to interfere in my concerns,
that I’m aware of.”</p>

<p>His instant alarm gratified her, although she continued
to look offended, and to sit very upright in her chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Don’t be angry, Elsie. I didn’t mean to offend you,
honour bright. Make it up!”</p>

<p>The pianist began some rattling dance-music and the
lights went out again.</p>

<p>Elsie immediately relaxed her pose, feeling her heart beat
more quickly in mingled doubt and anticipation.</p>

<p>The doubt was resolved almost within the instant.
Roberts pulled her towards him, bringing her face close to
his, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Kiss and be friends!”</p>

<p>All the while that the last film was showing, Elsie lay
almost in his arms, seeing nothing at all, conscious only of
feeling alive as she had never felt alive before.</p>

<p>Even when it was all over and they rose to go, that sense
of awakened vitality throbbed within her, and made her
unaware of fatigue.</p>

<p>“Follow me,” said Roberts authoritatively, and took his
place in front of her in the gangway. There he waited,
meekly and like everybody else, until the people in front
should have moved. But to Elsie there was masculinity
in the shelter of his narrow, drooping shoulders, as he stood
before her in his crumpled light overcoat, every now and then
shifting from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>She followed him step by step, pulling her hair into place
under the tam-o’-shanter, and settling it at its customary
rakish angle.</p>

<p>It was no longer raining, and a watery moon showed
through a haze.</p>

<p>They dawdled as soon as they were out of the crowd, with
linked arms and clasped hands.</p>

<p>“Swear you’ll write to me, Elsie.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Lordy, to think of all we might have done together
these three months I’ve been here, and I’ve never had more
than a word with you here and there!”</p>

<p>“I was at school all the time, till last week.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t going back to school again?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s over, praise be! I’m supposed to be taking
up typing and shorthand, some time, though there’s plenty
for two of us to do at home, <i>I</i> should have said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The faint reverberations of a church clock striking came
to them.</p>

<p>“Goodness, that’s never eleven o’clock striking! Well,
you will get me into a row and no mistake!”</p>

<p>She began to run, but stopped under a lamp just before
No. 15 was in sight.</p>

<p>He had kept pace with her high-heeled, uneven steps
easily, and stopped beside her.</p>

<p>“Say good-night to me properly, then.”</p>

<p>“How, properly? Good-night, Mr. Roberts, and thank
you ever so much. Oh, and <i>bonne voyage</i> to-morrow, in
case I don’t see you. Will that do?”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t. I want a kiss.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want much, do you?” she began half-heartedly,
and looking up and down the street as she spoke.</p>

<p>It was empty but for themselves.</p>

<p>Roberts caught hold of her and kissed her with violence.
Unresisting, Elsie put back her head and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Kiss me—you <i>shall</i> kiss me,” he gasped.</p>

<p>At the sense of constriction that came upon her with the
tightened grasp of his arms, Elsie gave a fluttering, strangled
scream and began to struggle.</p>

<p>“Let me go! You’re hurting me!”</p>

<p>He loosened his hold so abruptly that she nearly fell
down.</p>

<p>She began to hurry towards home, moving with the ugly,
jerking gait peculiar to women who walk from the knees.</p>

<p>“Shall I see you to-morrow before I go?” His voice
sounded oddly humble and crestfallen.</p>

<p>“I’ll come to the drawing-room for a minute—no one’s
ever there in the mornings.”</p>

<p>“What time, Elsie? I ought to be off at nine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, before that some time, I expect. I say, you’ve got
your key, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>A sharp misgiving assailed her as he began to fumble in
his pockets.</p>

<p>“Yes, all right.” He put it into the lock.</p>

<p>Elsie, relieved, stood on tiptoe and put her arms round
his neck. “Good-night, you dear,” she whispered. “Now
don’t begin again. Open the door and go in first, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the coast isn’t clear, just cough, and I’ll wait a bit. I’ll
see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>When he signed to her that the house was quiet, and that
she could safely enter, Elsie slipped past him like a shadow
while he felt about for matches, and flew upstairs. Her
mother slept in the back bedroom on the third floor, and
Elsie saw that her door was shut and that no streak of
light showed under it. Satisfied, she went up the next flight
of stairs to the bedroom.</p>

<p>Geraldine, of course, was bound to know of her escapade,
but Geraldine would either believe, or pretend to believe, that
Elsie had been with Irene Tidmarsh, and the two Palmer girls
always combined with one another against the sentimentalised
tyranny that Mrs. Palmer called “a mother’s rights.”</p>

<p>Geraldine was lying in bed, reading a paper novelette
by the light of a candle stuck into an empty medicine bottle
that stood on a chair beside her. She looked sallower than
ever now that she had undressed and put on a white flannelette
nightgown with a frill high at the neck and another one
at each wrist.</p>

<p>Her lank hair was rolled up into steel waving-pins. It
was one of Geraldine’s grievances that she should be obliged
to go to bed in curlers every night, while Elsie’s light curls
lay loose and ruffled on her pillow. Sometimes, when they
were on friendly terms, she and Elsie would speculate
together as to how the difficulty could be overcome when
Geraldine married, and could no longer go to bed and wake
up “looking a sight.”</p>

<p>She rolled over as Elsie cautiously opened the door.
“You’ve come at last, have you? How did you get in?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Roberts let me in. He knew I’d be late to-night,”
said Elsie calmly, beginning to pull off her clothes.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a nerve, I must say. Mother thinks you
were in bed ages ago. She came up after supper and said
you were in the kitchen. She was in the drawing-room
nearly all the evening, doing the polite to the Williamses.”</p>

<p>“Did she find out that supper hadn’t been cleared
away?”</p>

<p>“I suppose she didn’t, or she’d have been up here after
you. You’re in luck, young Elsie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“I shall have to go down and do it first thing to-morrow
before she’s down,” said Elsie, yawning.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Pictures.”</p>

<p>“With Ireen?”</p>

<p>“’M.”</p>

<p>“I shall ask her what they were like, next time I see
her,” said Geraldine significantly.</p>

<p>Elsie pulled the ribbon off her hair without untying it,
shuffled her clothes off on to the floor from beneath a
nightgown that was the counterpart of her sister’s, and
dabbed at her face with a sponge dipped in cold water.
She carefully parted her hair on the other side for the night,
and brushed it vigorously for some moments to promote
growth, but the worn bristles of her wooden-backed brush
were grey with dust and thick with ancient “combings.”</p>

<p>At the bedside Elsie knelt down for a few seconds with
her face hidden in her hands, as she had always done,
muttered an unthinking formula, and got into bed.</p>

<p>“You’re very sociable, I must say,” Geraldine exclaimed.
“Out half the night, and not a word to say when you do
come up!”</p>

<p>“I thought you had a headache.”</p>

<p>“A lot you care about my headache.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to put the light out now.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>They had always shared a bedroom and never exchanged
formal good-nights.</p>

<p>In the dark, a tremendous weariness suddenly came over
Elsie. She felt thankful to be in her warm, narrow bed,
and blissfully relived the evening’s experience.</p>

<p>She found that she could thrill profoundly to the memory
of those ardent moments, and even the bodily lassitude
that overwhelmed her held a certain luxuriousness.</p>

<p>Dimly, and without any conscious analysis, she felt that
for the first time in her sixteen years of life she had glimpsed
a reason why she should exist. It was for <i>this</i> that she had
been made.</p>

<p>No thought of the future preoccupied her for a moment.
She did not even regret that Norman Roberts should be
going away next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“I must get up in good time to-morrow, and get a word
with him in the drawing-room before he’s off,” was her
last waking thought.</p>

<p>But she was sleeping profoundly, her head under the bedclothes,
when Mrs. Palmer’s customary bang at the door
sounded next morning soon after six o’clock.</p>

<p>“Wake up, girls.”</p>

<p>“Awright!” Geraldine shouted back sleepily. If one
or other of them did not call out in reply, Mrs. Palmer would
come into the room in her grey dressing-gown and vigorously
shake the bed-posts of either bed.</p>

<p>They could hear her heelless slippers flapping away
again, and Elsie reluctantly roused herself.</p>

<p>“I simply must clear that supper-table before mother
goes down,” she thought. Still half asleep, and yawning
without restraint, she put on her thick coat over her nightgown,
and ran downstairs with bare feet.</p>

<p>The broken remains of supper, even to Elsie’s indifferent
eyes, looked horrible in the grim morning light.</p>

<p>She huddled everything out on a tray, pushed it out of
sight in the back kitchen, and ran upstairs again, her teeth
chattering with cold.</p>

<p>The still warm, tumbled bed was irresistible, and tearing
off her coat, Elsie buried herself in it once more.</p>

<p>She slept through Geraldine’s sketchy, scrambled toilet
and muttered abuse of her sister’s laziness, and did not stir
even when her senior, as the most unpleasant thing she
could do, opened her window, which had been closed all
night, and let in the damp, raw, foggy morning air.</p>

<p>Elsie did not stir again until the door was flung open and
Geraldine pulled the bedclothes off her roughly, and said
angrily:</p>

<p>“Get up, you lazy little brute! I had to wash all the
beastly things you left over last night, and mother and I
had to do the breakfasts, and see that young Roberts off
and everything.”</p>

<p>“Has Roberts gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course he has. It’s past nine, you lazy pig,
you——”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Elsie indifferently, stretching herself.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>

<h4>III</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a little while after Norman Roberts had gone away,
Elsie was bored. She received a letter from him, reproaching
her for not having been downstairs on the morning of
his departure, and giving her an address in Liverpool.
He begged her to write to him, and the letter ended with
half a dozen pen-and-ink crosses.</p>

<p>“<i>That’s for you, Elsie.</i>”</p>

<p>Elsie, who hated writing, collected with some difficulty
a pen, ink, and a coloured picture postcard of the Houses
of Parliament.</p>

<p>“Thanks for yours ever so much,” she wrote. “I
expect you’re having a fine old time in Liverpool. All here
send kind remembrances.”</p>

<p>Then, because she could not think what else to put, she
filled in the remaining space on the card with two large
crosses. “From your’s sincerely, Elsie.”</p>

<p>Roberts, after an interval, wrote once more, and this
letter Elsie did not answer at all. She was out nearly
every evening, walking, or lounging round the nearest
public park, with Irene Tidmarsh, Johnnie and Arthur
Osborne, and Stanley Begg.</p>

<p>Arthur Osborne was nominally Irene’s “friend,” but he,
as well as Johnnie and Stanley, always wanted to walk with
Elsie, or to sit next her at the cinema, and their preference
elated her, although the eldest of the three, Arthur, was
only twenty, and not one of them was earning more than
from fifteen to twenty shillings a week.</p>

<p>At last Irene and Elsie quarrelled about Arthur, and
Irene, furious, went to Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“It’s no more than my duty, Mrs. Palmer,” she virtuously
declared, “to let you know the way Elsie goes on.
The fellows may laugh and all that, but they don’t like it,
not really. I know my boy doesn’t, for one.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer, on different grounds, was quite as angry as
Irene.</p>

<p>She worked herself up, rehearsing to Geraldine all that
Irene had said, and a great deal that she alleged herself
to have replied, and she summoned her two unmarried
sisters, Aunt Ada and Aunt Gertie Cookson, to No. 15.</p>

<p>“What I want,” she explained, “is to give the gurl a
<i>fright</i>. I’m not going to have her making herself cheap
with young rag-tag-and-bobtail like those Osborne boys.
Why, a pretty gurl like Elsie could get married, as easily as
not, to a fellow with money. Nice enough people come to
this house, I’m sure. It’s on account of the gurls, simply,
that I’ve always been so particular about references and
all. I’m sure many’s the time I could have had the house
full but for not liking the looks of one or two that were
ready to pay anything for a front bedroom. But I’ve
always said to myself, ‘No,’ I’ve said, ‘a mother’s first duty
is to her children,’ I’ve said, especially being in the position
of father and mother both, as you might say.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’ve always been a wonderful mother,
Edie,” said Aunt Ada.</p>

<p>“Well,” Mrs. Palmer conceded, mollified.</p>

<p>When Geraldine came in with the tea-tray to the drawing-room
that Mrs. Palmer was for once able to use, because the
Williamses, her only guests, had a sitting-room of their
own, the aunts received her with marked favour.</p>

<p>“Mother’s helpful girlie!” said Aunt Gertie, as Geraldine
put down the plate of bread-and-butter, the Madeira cake
on a glass cake stand, and another plate of rock-buns.</p>

<p>“Where’s Elsie?” Mrs. Palmer asked significantly.</p>

<p>“Cutting out in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Tell her to come along up. She knows your aunties are
here.”</p>

<p>“I told her to come, and she made use of a very vulgar
expression,” Geraldine spitefully declared.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s come over Elsie, I’m sure,” Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Palmer declared helplessly. “She’s learnt all these low
tricks and manners from that friend of hers, that Ireen
Tidmarsh.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer was very angry with Irene for her revelations,
although she was secretly rather enjoying her younger
daughter’s notoriety.</p>

<p>“Get that naughty gurl up from the kitchen directly,”
she commanded Geraldine. “No—wait a minute, I’ll
go myself.”</p>

<p>With extraordinary agility she heaved her considerable
bulk out of her low chair and left the room.</p>

<p>“And what have you been doing with yourself lately?”
Aunt Gertie enquired of Geraldine.</p>

<p>She was stout and elderly-looking, with a mouth over-crowded
by large teeth. She was older than Mrs. Palmer,
and Aunt Ada was some years younger than either, and wore,
with a sort of permanent smirk, the remains of an ash-blond
prettiness. They were just able, in 1913, to live in the
house at Wimbledon that their father had left them, on
their joint income.</p>

<p>“There’s always heaps to do in the house, I’m sure, Aunt
Gertie,” said Geraldine vaguely. “And I’m not strong
enough to go to work anywhere, really I’m not. Now Elsie’s
different. She could do quite well in the shorthand-typing,
but she’s bone idle—that’s what she is. Or there’s
dressmaking—Elsie’s clever with her needle, that I will
say for her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer came back with Elsie behind her. The girl
reluctantly laid her face for a moment against each of the
withered ones that bumped towards her in conventional
greeting.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Aunt Gertie. Hallo, Aunt Ada,” she said lifelessly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer began to pour out the tea, and whilst they
ate and drank elegantly, the conversation was allowed to take
its course without any reference to the real point at issue.</p>

<p>“What are these Williamses like, that have got the
downstairs sitting-room, Edie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they <i>are</i> nice people,” said Mrs. Palmer enthusiastically.
“A solicitor, he is, and only just waiting to find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
house. I believe they’ve ever such a lot of furniture in
store. They lived at Putney before, but it didn’t suit
Mrs. Williams. She’s delicate.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer raised her eyebrows and glanced meaningly
at the aunts.</p>

<p>Aunt Ada gazed eagerly back at her.</p>

<p>“Go and get some more bread-and-butter, Elsie,” commanded
Mrs. Palmer, and when the girl had left the room
she nodded at Aunt Ada.</p>

<p>“You know, Mrs. Williams isn’t very strong just now.
She’s been unlucky before, too—twice, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“But when? Surely you aren’t going to have anything
like that <i>here</i>?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no! I told her it was out of the question, and
she quite understood. It isn’t till April, and they hope to
move into their new house after Christmas. <i>She</i> must be
about fifteen years younger than <i>he</i> is, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“How strange!” said Aunt Gertie.</p>

<p>Both she and Aunt Ada were always intensely interested
in any detail about anybody, whether known or unknown
to them personally.</p>

<p>“Rather remarkable, isn’t it, that there should be an
event on the way——” Aunt Ada began.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer frowned heavily at her as Elsie came back
into the room. “It’s ever so long since we’ve seen you, as
I was just saying,” she remarked in a loud and artificial
voice, making Elsie wish that she had waited outside the
door and listened. She thought that they must have been
talking about her.</p>

<p>After tea was over, they did talk about her. Mrs.
Palmer began: “You can let Geraldine take the tea-things,
Elsie. It won’t be the first time, lately, she’s done your
share of helping your poor mother as well as her own.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” from Aunt Gertie.</p>

<p>“Geraldine’s health isn’t as strong as yours, either.
She looks to me as though she might go into consumption,
if you want to know,” said Aunt Ada.</p>

<p>They looked at Elsie, and she looked sulkily back at them.</p>

<p>It was one of the days on which she was at her plainest.
Her face looked fat and heavy, the high cheek-bones actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
seemed to be pushing her lower lids upwards until her
eyes appeared as mere slits. Her mouth was closed sullenly.</p>

<p>“Elsie’s not been a good gurl lately, and she knows it
very well. Her own mother doesn’t seem to have any
influence with her, so perhaps ...” said Mrs. Palmer to
her sisters, but looking at her child, “perhaps you’ll see
what you can do. It’s not a thing I like to talk about,
ever, but we know very well what happens to a gurl who
spends her time larking about the streets with fellows.
To think that a child of mine——”</p>

<p>“What do you do it <i>for</i>, Elsie?” enquired Aunt Gertie,
in a practical tone, as though only such shrewdness as hers
could have seized at once upon this vital point.</p>

<p>“Do what?”</p>

<p>“What your poor mother says.”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t said anything, yet.”</p>

<p>“Don’t prevaricate with me, you bad gurl, you,” said
Mrs. Palmer sharply. “You know very well what I mean,
and so do others. The tales that get carried to me about
your goings-on! First one fellow, and then another, and
even running after a whipper-snapper that’s already going
with another gurl!”</p>

<p>“This is a bit of Ireen’s work, I suppose,” said Elsie.
“I can’t help it if her boy’s sick of her already, can I?
I’m sure I don’t care anything about Arthur Osborne, or
any of them, for that matter.”</p>

<p>The implication that Elsie Palmer, at sixteen and a half,
could afford to distinguish between her admirers, obscurely
infuriated the spinster Aunt Ada.</p>

<p>She began to tremble with wrath, and white dents
appeared at the corners of her mouth and nostrils. “You’re
not the first gurl whose talked that way, and ended by
disgracing herself and her family,” she cried shrilly. “If
I were your mother, I’d give you a sound whipping, I
declare to goodness I would.”</p>

<p>Elsie shot a vicious look at her aunt out of the corners
of her slanting eyes. “Are the grapes sour, Aunt Ada?”
she asked insolently.</p>

<p>Aunt Ada turned white. “D’you hear that, Edie?”
she gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Yes, I do,” said Mrs. Palmer vigorously, “and I’m
not going to put up with it, not for a single instant. Elsie
Palmer, you beg your auntie’s pardon directly minute.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>The vast figure of Mrs. Palmer in her Sunday black frock
upreared itself and stood, weighty and menacing, over her
child. She had never hit either of her daughters since
childhood, but neither of them had ever openly defied her.</p>

<p>“Do as I say.”</p>

<p>“N-no.”</p>

<p>Elsie’s voice quavered, and she burst into tears. Mrs.
Palmer let out a sigh of relief. She knew that she had won.</p>

<p>“Do—as—I—say.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m very sorry, Aunt Ada, if I said what I
didn’t ought.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t what you said, dear,” said Aunt Ada untruthfully.
“It was the way you said it.”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Palmer pursued her advantage. “You may
as well understand, Elsie, that this isn’t going on. I haven’t
got the time, nor yet the strength, to go chasing after you
all day long. I know well enough you’re not to be trusted—out
of the house the minute my back’s the other way—and
coming in at all hours, and always a tale of some sort
to account for where you’ve been. So, my lady, you’ve
got to make up your mind to a different state of things.
What’s it to be: a job as a typewriter, or apprenticed to
the millinery? Your kind Aunt Gertie’s got a friend in the
business, and she’s offered to speak for you.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather the typing,” said Elsie sullenly.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll come with me and see about a post to-morrow
morning as ever is,” said Mrs. Palmer. “It’s your
own doing. You could have stayed at home like a lady,
helping Mother and Geraldine, if you’d cared to. But I’m
not going to have any gurl of mine getting herself a name
the way you’ve been doing.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I can go now?”</p>

<p>“You can go if you want to,” said Mrs. Palmer, flushed
with victory. “And mind and remember what I’ve said,
for I mean every word of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>It was only too evident that she did, and Elsie went out
of the room crying angrily. She did not really mind the
idea of becoming a typist in an office or a shop in the very
least, but she hated having been humiliated in front of her
aunts and Geraldine.</p>

<p>As she went upstairs, sobbing, she met Mrs. Williams
coming down. She was a gentle, unhealthy-looking woman
of about thirty, so thin that her clothes always looked as
though they might drop off her bending, angular body.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, dear?”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>

<p>“Come into the sitting-room, won’t you, and rest a
minute?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Elsie reflected that there would probably be a fire in the
sitting-room, and in her own room it was cold, and she knew
that the bed was still unmade.</p>

<p>She followed Mrs. Williams into the sitting-room, where
Mr. Williams sat reading a Sunday illustrated paper.</p>

<p>“Horace, this poor child is quite upset. Give her a
seat, dear.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Elsie, confused.</p>

<p>She had only seen Mr. Williams half a dozen times. He
always breakfasted and went out early, and Elsie, of late,
had eaten her supper in the kitchen. They had met at meal-times
on Sundays, but she had never spoken to him, and
thought him elderly and uninteresting.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams was indeed forty-three years old, desiccated
and inclined to baldness, a small, rather paunchy man.</p>

<p>His little, hard grey eyes gleamed on Elsie now from
behind his pince-nez.</p>

<p>“No bad news, I hope?” His voice was dry, and rather
formal, with great precision of utterance.</p>

<p>His wife put her emaciated hand on the girl’s shoulder.
“Two heads are better than one, as they say. Horace and
I would be glad to help you, if we can.”</p>

<p>“It is silly to be upset, like,” said Elsie, sniffing. “Mother
and I had a few words, that’s all, and I’m to get hold of a job.
I’m sure I don’t know why I’m crying. I shall be glad
enough to get out of this place for a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Hush, dear! That isn’t a nice way to speak of your
home, now is it? But about this job, now. Horace and I
might be able to help you there.”</p>

<p>She hesitated and looked at her husband. “What about
the Woolleys, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes—ye-es.”</p>

<p>“These are some new acquaintances of ours, and they’ve
a lovely house at Hampstead, but Mrs. Woolley isn’t any
too strong, and I know she’s looking out for someone to help
her with the children and all. It wouldn’t be going to
service—nothing at all like that, of course; I know you
wouldn’t think of that, dear—but just be one of the family
at this lovely house of theirs.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t in the country, is it?” Elsie asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Oh no, dear, Hampstead I said. Only three-quarters
of an hour by ’bus from town. Don’t you like the country?”</p>

<p>“Too dead-alive.”</p>

<p>“Well, these people that I’m telling you about, this
Doctor and Mrs. Woolley, they’re youngish married people,
and most pleasant. Aren’t they, Horace? And they’ve
two sweet kiddies—a boy and a girl. Don’t you think
you’d like me to speak to Mrs. Woolley, now, dear?”</p>

<p>Elsie was not sure. She felt that Mrs. Williams was
going too fast. “I don’t know,” she said ungraciously.</p>

<p>“She’s right,” said Mr. Williams. “We mustn’t be
in too great a hurry. Write to your friend Mrs. Woolley
by all means, my dear, and let this young lady think it over,
and have a talk with her mother and sister. She may not
care to live away from home altogether.”</p>

<p>“Horace is always so business-like,” said Mrs. Williams
admiringly. “I expect he’s right, dear. But you’d like me
to write, just to see if there’s any chance, now wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“What should I have to do there?”</p>

<p>“Why, just help look after the kiddies. I’m sure you
love children, now don’t you?—and perhaps make a dainty
cake or two for afternoon tea, if Mrs. Woolley’s busy, or do
a bit of sewing for her—and keep the doctor amused in the
evening if she has to go up early.”</p>

<p>It was the last item that decided Elsie. “I don’t mind,”
she said in her usual formula of acceptance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Mrs. Williams was delighted. “I’m going to write off
this very evening,” she exclaimed enthusiastically.
“Horace and I have to go out now, but I shan’t forget.
It’ll be a lovely chance for you, dear.”</p>

<p>Elsie rather enjoyed telling her mother and Geraldine
that evening that “Mrs. Williams was wild” to secure her
services for a lady friend of hers, who had a lovely house at
Hampstead.</p>

<p>“This Mrs. Woolley is delicate, and she wants a young
lady to help her. Of course, there’s a servant for the work
of the house.”</p>

<p>“If she’s counting on you to help her, the same as you’ve
helped your poor mother since you left school, she’s got a
disappointment in store,” said Mrs. Palmer grimly. “I
don’t know that I’d let you go, even if you get the chance.”</p>

<p>In the end, Geraldine, who wanted the top bedroom to
herself, and who thought that Elsie, and the problem of
Elsie’s behaviour, were occupying too much attention,
persuaded Mrs. Palmer that it would never do to offend the
Williamses.</p>

<p>“Besides,” she argued, “it’ll be one less to feed here,
and we can easily move her bed into the second-floor back
room and use it, if we want to put up an extra gentleman
any time.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer gave in, contingent on a personal interview
with Mrs. Woolley.</p>

<p>This was arranged through Mrs. Williams. She one day
ushered into the dining-room of No. 15 a large, showily-dressed
woman, who might have been any age between
thirty-eight and forty-five.</p>

<p>Her rings, and her light, smart dress impressed Elsie,
and her suggestion of paying twenty-five pounds a year for
Elsie’s services satisfied Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>“My hubby’s a frightfully busy man,” Mrs. Woolley
remarked. “He isn’t at home a great deal, but he likes me
to do everything on the most liberal scale—always has
done—and he said to me, ‘Amy, you’re not strong,’ he
said, ‘even if you have a high colour’—so many people are
deceived by that, Mrs. Palmer—‘and you’ve got to have
help. Someone who can be a bit of a companion to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
when I’m out on my rounds or busy in the surgery, and who
you can trust with Gladys and Sonnie.’”</p>

<p>“I’m sure Elsie would like to help you, Mrs. Woolley,
and you’ll find her to be trusted,” Mrs. Palmer replied
firmly. “I’ve always brought up my gurls to be useful,
even if they <i>are</i> ladies.”</p>

<p>“She looks young,” said Mrs. Woolley critically.</p>

<p>“She’ll put her hair up before she comes to you. It may
be a mother’s weakness, Mrs. Woolley, but I’m free to
confess that Elsie’s my baby, and I’ve let her keep her curls
down perhaps longer than I should.”</p>

<p>Elsie remained demure beneath what she perfectly
recognised as a form of self-hypnotism, rather than conscious
humbug, on the part of her mother.</p>

<p>There was at least no sentimentality in her leave-taking
a week later.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Elsie, and mind and not be up to any of
your tricks, now. Mother’ll expect you on Sunday next.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mother,” said Elsie indifferently.</p>

<p>She had that morning washed her hair, which made it
very soft and fluffy, and had pinned it up in half a dozen fat
little sausages at the back of her head. She was preoccupied
with her own appearance, and with the knowledge
that the newly-revealed back of her neck was white and
pretty. She wore a blue serge coat and skirt, a low-cut blouse
of very pale pink figured voile, black shoes and stockings,
and a dashing little hat, round and brimless, with a big black
bow that she had herself added to it on the previous night.</p>

<p>In the Tube railway, a man in the seat opposite to
her stared at her very hard. Elsie looked away, but kept
on turning her eyes furtively towards him, without moving
her head. Every time that she did this, their eyes met.</p>

<p>The man was young, with bold eyes and a wide mouth.
Presently he smiled at her.</p>

<p>Elsie immediately looked down at the toes of her new
black shoes, moving them this way and that as though to
catch the light reflected in their polish.</p>

<p>At Belsize Park Station she got out, carrying her suitcase.</p>

<p>As she passed the youth in the corner, she glanced at him
again, then stepped out of the train and went up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
platform without looking behind her. Although there was a
crowd on the platform and in the lift, and although she never
looked round, Elsie could tell that he was following her.</p>

<p>The feeling that this gave her, half fearful and half
delighted, was an agreeable titilation to her vanity. She
had experienced it before, just as she had often been followed
in the street before, but it never lost its flavour.
When she was in the street, she began to walk steadily
along, gazing straight in front of her.</p>

<p>She heard steps on the pavement just behind her, and
then the young man of the train accosted her, raising his
hat as he spoke:</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to give me the pleasure of your
acquaintance?” he suavely enquired.</p>

<p>His voice was very polite, and his eyes looked faintly
amused.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Elsie cried in a startled tone. “I don’t think
I know you, do I?”</p>

<p>“All the more reason to begin now. Mayn’t I carry that
bag for you?”</p>

<p>He took it and they walked on together.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can tell me where Mortimer Crescent is,”
Elsie said primly.</p>

<p>“It will be my proudest privilege to escort you there,”
he replied in mock bombastic tones.</p>

<p>It was a form of persiflage well known to Elsie, and she
laughed in reply. “You <i>are</i> silly, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Now if you called me cheeky, perhaps....”</p>

<p>“I’ll call you cheeky fast enough. A regular Cheeky
Charlie, by the look of you!”</p>

<p>“I think I was born cheeky,” he agreed complacently.
“D’you know what first made me want to talk to you?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That pink thing you’ve got on with all the ribbon
showing through it.”</p>

<p>He put out his hand and, with a familiar gesture, touched
the front of her blouse just below her collar-bone.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t,” said Elsie, startled.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t allow liberties.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“We’ll have to settle what liberties are, miss. Come for
a walk this evening and we can talk about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t! I’m just going into a new job.”</p>

<p>She purposely used the word “new,” because she wanted
him to think her experienced and grown-up.</p>

<p>“What can a kiddie like you do?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m private secretary to a duke, didn’t you know
that?”</p>

<p>“Lucky duke! Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’d be telling. This isn’t Mortimer Crescent?”</p>

<p>“It is, very much so indeed, begging your pardon for
contradicting a lady.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t come any further,” begged Elsie. “Ta-ta,
and thanks for carrying the bag.”</p>

<p>“When do I see you again?”</p>

<p>“I dunno! Never, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Seven o’clock to-night?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t, really.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, then? I’ll be outside the Belsize Park
station, and we’ll go on the razzle-dazzle together. I’d
like to show you a bit of life. Seven o’clock, mind.”</p>

<p>“You and your seven o’clock! You’ll be somewhere
with your young lady, I know.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t got one.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t she have you?” scoffed Elsie. “No
accounting for tastes, is there?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you pay for this to-morrow night, you little
witch—see if I don’t!”</p>

<p>Elsie had caught hold of her suitcase, and began to walk
away from him.</p>

<p>“Which number are you going to?”</p>

<p>“Eight.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ring the bell for you.”</p>

<p>He did so, rather to her fright and vexation. She urged
him in low tones to go away, but he continued to stand
beside her on the doorstep, laughing at her annoyance,
until a capped and aproned maid opened the door.</p>

<p>Then he lifted his hat, said “Good-night” very politely,
and went away.</p>

<p>She never saw him again.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span> found the life at 8, Mortimer Crescent, a pleasant
contrast to that of her own home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woolley herself never came downstairs before
half-past nine or ten o’clock, and then she was very
often only partly dressed, wearing a stained and rumpled
silk kimono and a dirty lace-and-ribbon-trimmed boudoir
cap. Elsie’s only duty in the morning was to keep the
two children quiet while their mother slept. This she
achieved by the simple expedient of letting them go to
bed so late at night that they lay like little logs far on into
the morning.</p>

<p>Elsie shared a bedroom with Gladys, and Sonnie’s cot
was in a dressing-room opening into theirs.</p>

<p>The children were rather pallid and unwholesome, never
quite free from colds or coughs, and seeming too spiritless
even to be naughty. They went to a kindergarten school
from eleven to four o’clock every day, and Elsie took them
there and fetched them away again.</p>

<p>During the daytime she was supposed to dust the
dining-room, drawing-room, and Mrs. Woolley’s bedroom,
but she soon found out that no accumulation of dust,
cigarette ends, or actual dirt would ever be noticed by the
mistress of the house.</p>

<p>There was a general servant, who was inclined to resent
Elsie’s presence in the house, and who left very soon after
her arrival. Another one came, and was sent away at the
end of a week’s trial because Mrs. Woolley said she was
impertinent, and after an uncomfortable interim, during
which Elsie nominally “did” the cooking, and they lived
upon tinned goods and pressed beef, there came a short-lived
succession of maids who never stayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>At first, Doctor Woolley was seldom seen by Elsie. He
went out early, and both he and his wife were out nearly
every night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woolley told Elsie that they adored the theatre.
Elsie, who adored it too, had on these occasions, after
putting the two children to bed, to remain sulkily behind
while Dr. and Mrs. Woolley, after an early meal, walked
away together to the Underground station. Sometimes
Dr. Woolley was sent for, and could not go, and Mrs.
Woolley rang up one of her friends on the telephone—always
another woman—and took her instead. One
evening after this had happened, the doctor returned
unexpectedly early, just as Elsie had finished putting
Gladys and Sonnie to bed.</p>

<p>She was coming downstairs, some needlework in her
hands, as the doctor slammed the hall door behind him.
Instantly the prospect of a dreary evening, probably to be
spent in sucking sweets and surreptitiously looking over
everything on Mrs. Woolley’s untidy writing-table, disappeared.</p>

<p>“Hallo! And how was you to-morrow, Miss Elsie?”
cried the doctor genially.</p>

<p>He was a stout, middle-aged man, jocose and very often
foul-mouthed, with nicotine stains on his fingers and
grease spots on his waistcoat.</p>

<p>He affected a manner of speech that Elsie found intensely
amusing.</p>

<p>“You and I all on our ownie own, eh? Where’s the
missus?—and the kids?”</p>

<p>“The children are in bed, and Mrs. Woolley’s gone to the
play with Miss Smith, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t you got a drink of cocoa and a bit of bread
for a poor man, kind lady?”</p>

<p>Elsie burst out laughing. “You’re so silly, I can’t help
laughing!”</p>

<p>“‘Silly,’ says she, quite the lady. ‘How’s that?’ says
I; to which she says, ‘Not at all,’ says she, and the same to
you and many of them,” was the doctor’s reply.</p>

<p>Elsie giggled wildly.</p>

<p>“Come along now, tell that slut in the kitchen to stir her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
stumps and bring some food to the dining-room. Have you
had your supper yet?”</p>

<p>“No, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Then you and I will make a party-carry, otherwise a
<i>tête-à-tête</i>, otherwise a night of it. Run along and I’ll get
out something that will make your hair curl.”</p>

<p>Elsie had heard this formula before, and understood
that the doctor would unlock the door of the tiny wine-cellar
and bring out a bottle.</p>

<p>She told the maid to bring supper for Doctor Woolley
to the dining-room, but she herself carried in her own plate
and cup and saucer, knowing that Florrie was quite aware
she had already eaten her evening meal with Mrs. Woolley.</p>

<p>The doctor was drawing the cork out of a bottle as she
came into the room. The electric light was turned on, and
the small dining-room, with drawn red curtains, and the
gas-fire burning, was bright and hot.</p>

<p>The doctor ate heavily of cold meat and pickles, prodding
with a fork amongst the mixed contents of the glass
jar until he had annexed all the pickled onions that it
contained.</p>

<p>He made Elsie sit down and eat too, but he made no demur
to her assurance that she wasn’t hungry and only wanted
some cake and a cup of cocoa.</p>

<p>At first the doctor gave all his attention to the food and
warmth of which he stood in need, and Elsie felt self-conscious,
and as though she were out of place.</p>

<p>She ceased to answer his occasional facetious interjections,
and threw herself back in her chair, gazing down at her own
clasped hands.</p>

<p>Gradually the atmosphere of the room altered, and
Elsie’s instinct told her that the current of magnetism that
had never failed her yet was awakening its inevitable
response in the man opposite.</p>

<p>At once she felt confident again, and at her ease.</p>

<p>“I say, why didn’t the missus take you to the theatre
when she found I was busy?” he queried suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I suppose she never thought of
such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Wanted someone nearer her own age, eh? You won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
find the ladies running after someone younger and prettier
than themselves, you know. Too much of a contrast.”</p>

<p>Elsie laughed self-consciously.</p>

<p>“All the better for me, eh? I’m not often allowed to
get you all to myself like this, eh? Ah, when I was a
gay young bacheldore things was different, they was.”</p>

<p>Elsie laughed again, this time in spontaneous tribute to
the humour of wilful mis-pronunciation.</p>

<p>“Now, what about this bottle that you made me get out,
eh? Where are the glasses?”</p>

<p>He found two in the cupboard of the carved walnut
sideboard, and poured a liberal allowance of port from the
bottle into each.</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t, Doctor! You must excuse me, really
you must. I simply couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, couldn’t you, really, awfully, truly couldn’t?” he
mimicked in exaggerated falsetto. “Well, you’ve got to—so
that’s <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“I say so. I. <i>Moi.</i> ‘<i>Je</i>,’ replies I, knowing the language.
Come along now, be a good girl.”</p>

<p>He laid his big coarse hand on hers, and at the contact
the familiar thrill of sensuous excitement and pleasure ran
through her.</p>

<p>“Are you going to drink it?” he said masterfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose I must try it. I’ve never tasted wine
before,” Elsie added truthfully.</p>

<p>“High time you began, then.”</p>

<p>He went back to his place, and drank in long gulps, first
saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Our hands have met—our lips not yet—</div>
<div class="verse">Here’s hoping!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Elsie sipped at her glass, choked, and put it down again.
“How beastly!” she said, shuddering.</p>

<p>“You’ll get used to it.”</p>

<p>“No, I shan’t, because I’m not going to touch the horrid
stuff again.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that.”</p>

<p>He came round beside her again, and held her with one
arm while he tried to force the glass to her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Elsie turned her head aside, struggling and laughing.</p>

<p>“You young monkey!” said the doctor, and forced her
face upwards with his free hand.</p>

<p>His breath was in her face, and his inflamed eyes gazing
into hers. Instinctively Elsie ceased to struggle and closed
her eyes.</p>

<p>He kissed her mouth violently. “God! You haven’t
got much to learn. Who’s been teaching you?” he asked
her roughly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you oughtn’t to have done that,” said Elsie feebly.</p>

<p>“Rubbish! You know I’ve been thinking of nothing
else since you’ve been here.”</p>

<p>He sat down and pulled her on to his knee. “Now tell
me all about it,” he commanded. His manner was no
longer facetious, and he had dropped his jocosities of
speech.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>“Sit still.”</p>

<p>“Suppose someone were to come in?”</p>

<p>“No one will.”</p>

<p>She wriggled a little, half-heartedly, and he gripped her
more firmly round the waist. The scene degenerated into
a sort of scrambling orgy of animalism.</p>

<p>Elsie, although she was frightened, was also exhilarated
at the evidence that she possessed power over a man—and
a married man—so much older than herself.</p>

<p>She knew that if at any moment he became unmanageable,
she had only to threaten to call the servant, and she
fully intended to do so as a last resort. But in the meanwhile
there was an odd and breathless fascination in feeling
that she stood so close to a peril in which lay all the lurking
excitement of the unknown.</p>

<p>A sudden wail from the room overhead startled them both.</p>

<p>“That’s Sonnie!” gasped Elsie.</p>

<p>“Oh, blast the kid!”</p>

<p>But he let her go and she flew upstairs, glad, and yet
disappointed, at her release.</p>

<p>She dismissed Sonnie’s nightmare with sharp injunctions
not to be silly, tucked him up and decided to go to her own
room and not to return downstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“That’ll show him,” she murmured, simulating to herself
a conventional indignation.</p>

<p>In reality, she was intensely excited, and she had been
tossing about her bed restlessly for nearly an hour before
reaction overtook her, and she became prey to a strange,
baffled feeling of having been cheated of the climax due to so
emotional an episode.</p>

<p>When at last Elsie slept, it was after she had heard Mrs.
Woolley come in and the doctor bolt the hall door and both
of them go upstairs to their bedroom, on the other side of
the landing.</p>

<p>Every day now held the potentialities of amorous adventure.</p>

<p>Sometimes Elsie did not see the doctor all day long,
sometimes they met in the evenings, with Mrs. Woolley
present, and he talked in the old facetious style, watching
Elsie furtively as she giggled in response.</p>

<p>He very often made excuses for passing things to her at
meals, so that their hands touched, and he pressed her foot
under the table with his big one, or rubbed it up and down
her ankle.</p>

<p>There were moments, however, when they were alone
together, and then he pulled her to him and kissed her
roughly all over her face and neck, pushing her abruptly
away at the first possibility of interruption. Once or twice,
at the imminent risk of being discovered, he had snatched
hasty and provocative kisses from her lips in a chance
encounter on the stairs, or even behind the shelter of an
open door.</p>

<p>The perpetual fear of detection, no less than the tantalising
incompleteness of their relations, was a strain upon
Elsie’s nerves, and she was keyed up to a pitch of unusual
sensitiveness when the inevitable crisis came.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woolley, in a new blue dress that looked too tight
under the arms, had taken the children to a party.</p>

<p>The maid Florrie was out for the afternoon. Elsie,
restless and on edge, terribly wanted an excuse to go down
to the surgery. At last she found one, and after listening at
the door to make certain that no belated patient was with
the doctor, she knocked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Come in!”</p>

<p>He was sitting at the writing-table, rapidly turning over
the leaves of a big book.</p>

<p>“Elsie!”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you please, Doctor,” she minced, “they’ve all
gone out, and Mrs. Woolley left a message to say if you
<i>could</i> go and fetch her and the children from 85, Lower
Park Avenue, about seven o’clock——”</p>

<p>“Stow it, Elsie! D’you mean to say you and I are the
only people left in the place? Where’s that damned slut
in the kitchen, eh?”</p>

<p>“It’s Florrie’s afternoon out, Doctor, but——”</p>

<p>“Florrie be damned! Look here, Elsie, this sort of
thing can’t go on.”</p>

<p>She backed until she stood against the wall, feeling the
warm blood surge into her face and looking at him through
half-closed eyelids.</p>

<p>“What sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“You know very well what I mean. Look at me.
D’you think I’m a man?”</p>

<p>He thrust out his chest and doubled up his arms, standing
with his legs wide apart. In spite of his grossness and
unwholesome fat, Elsie thrilled to the suggestion of his
masculine strength.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Well, I tell you no man’s going to stand what you’re
making me stand. Elsie, you little devil! Don’t you know
you’re driving me mad? God, if I could tell you the sort
of dreams I get at night, now!”</p>

<p>“About me?” she asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” His voice was savage, and she suddenly
saw sweat glistening on his upper lip and round his nose.</p>

<p>Elsie decided to begin to cry. “It frightens me when
you shout at me like that. Perhaps I’d better go,” she said
sobbingly.</p>

<p>“No, no, no! I say, what a brute I am! Come here and
be comforted, little girl.”</p>

<p>He sat down heavily in the revolving chair before the
writing-table and held out his hand.</p>

<p>Elsie advanced slowly, without looking at him, until she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
came within reach of his arm. Then he caught hold of her
and drew her on to his knee, gripping her tightly until
her weight sank against his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Let me kiss all the tears away. What a hound I am
to make you cry! Was’ums very mis’mis?”</p>

<p>He petted and soothed her, kissing the back of her neck
and her dust-coloured curls, murmuring absurd, infantile
phrases.</p>

<p>Presently he whispered: “D’you love me?”</p>

<p>Elsie laughed and would not answer, and he struggled
with her playfully, pulling her about, and grasping at her
with his big hands.</p>

<p>After the horse-play, she put both arms round his neck
and lay still.</p>

<p>“I want to know something,” said Doctor Woolley slowly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know more than a good little girl ought to
know?”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“About—life. About being kissed, for instance. I’m
not the first, my girl, not by a long, long way. You’re the
sort that begins early, <i>I</i> know.”</p>

<p>“You’ve a nerve!” Elsie ejaculated, not knowing what
to say.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s true what I’m saying, isn’t it? I mean,
you’ve let fellows kiss you?”</p>

<p>“Just boys, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t anyone taught you anything besides kissing,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Of course not! What do you take me for, I’d like to
know? Mother brought up me and my sister like ladies,
let me tell you. Besides, I don’t know what you’re driving
at, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“No!” screamed Elsie in a sudden, only half-assumed,
panic.</p>

<p>She sprang up, but he pulled her back again.</p>

<p>“You silly little fool! You don’t suppose I’d really say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
or do anything to frighten you, do you? Why, you’re
much too precious.”</p>

<p>He kissed her again and again.</p>

<p>“Tell me one thing, though. You did know what I
meant, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Of course you did! A girl like you couldn’t help
knowing. My God, I wish I’d known you ten years ago.
I wasn’t married then.”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to talk like that.”</p>

<p>“Why not? It’s true. Amy’s as cold as ice—not a
real woman at all. And she’s as jealous as the devil.
I’ve always wondered why she let anyone like you come into
the house at all. It’s a miracle she hasn’t spotted us yet.”</p>

<p>“It’d be all up with me being here if she did,” said
Elsie shrewdly.</p>

<p>“If you go, I swear I’ll go with you,” said Doctor
Woolley, but he said it without conviction, and Elsie knew
it. “Can’t do without you, little one, at any price, now.
But you’ve got to be even sweeter than you’ve been to me
yet.”</p>

<p>Elsie shivered a little, excited and disturbed, and in part
genuinely shocked.</p>

<p>“When will you, Elsie?”</p>

<p>His breath on her neck was hot and hurried.</p>

<p>She jumped off his knee. “Oh, look, it’s getting on for
half-past six! You’ll have to be off.”</p>

<p>“Come back! You haven’t told me what I want to
know yet.” He grabbed at her dress.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Elsie.</p>

<p>In the second during which he turned, arrested, she
slipped out of the room.</p>

<p>Her heart was beating very fast, and her face burning.</p>

<p>She half expected him to follow her, but he did not do so;
and she was partly relieved and partly disappointed.</p>

<p>She saw him again at supper, which the Woolleys always
called dinner, and the consciousness between them caused
a singular constraint to pervade the atmosphere. Mrs.
Woolley, for the first time, seemed to be aware of it, and
every now and then turned sharp, bulging brown eyes from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
her husband to Elsie, compressing her thin lips until they
formed a mere hard line in her red face.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, she told Elsie to go upstairs
and fetch one of her evening dresses. “I want to see if I
can’t smarten it up a bit,” she explained. “I’m in rags, not
fit to be seen.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stand you a new frock, Amy,” said the doctor
suddenly. “How much d’you want, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Why, whatever’s up, Herbert? I’m sure it’s ages
since I’ve had a thing, and I’d be only too delighted——”</p>

<p>She broke off.</p>

<p>“Run up, Elsie, will you? The primrose dress, with the
black lace, in the left-hand corner of my wardrobe....”</p>

<p>Elsie went, envious of the new dress, and at the same time
thinking mockingly of Mrs. Woolley’s mottled skin and the
lines that ran from her heavy nostrils to her sagging chin.
Dresses and jewellery ought to be for girls who were young
and pretty, not married women, plain and stout, like Mrs.
Woolley. When Elsie came down again the doctor had gone,
and Mrs. Woolley was in high good humour.</p>

<p>“I’ll get some tulle to-morrow, Elsie, and we can freshen
it up round the neck and sleeves. You’d better rip off all
this old stuff. And look here—you’re handy with your
fingers—you can take the lace off and put it on that old
navy blouse of mine, that’s got no collar. You know the
one I mean ... you can drape it a bit....”</p>

<p>Elsie assented rather sulkily.</p>

<p>“Doctor Woolley’s so generous,” said Mrs. Woolley complacently.
“He’s for ever giving me things, me and the
children. If you knew more of the world, Elsie, you’d
realise how lucky a woman is when she gets a hubby like
mine who’s never so much as looked at another woman since
he married. Some men aren’t like that, I can tell you.
The tales I could let out, if I cared to, that I’ve heard
from some! But if Doctor Woolley’s manner sometimes puts
ideas into people’s heads, why, they’ve only themselves
to blame is what I always say. He wouldn’t give a thought
to anyone but me, not really.”</p>

<p>She looked full at Elsie as she spoke, and Elsie stared
back at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>The girl was puzzled and angry, not feeling certain that
she knew whether Mrs. Woolley really believed her own
words, or was using them to convey an oblique warning.</p>

<p>“If she really imagines that, she must be a fool,” thought
Elsie contemptuously, only to veer round uneasily a moment
later to the conviction that Mrs. Woolley had been talking
<i>at</i> her.</p>

<p>It was the latter unpleasant belief that prevailed, without
possibility of mistake, in the course of the next few days.
Whenever the doctor was in the house, Mrs. Woolley made a
point of remaining at his side, and during the hours when
he was in the surgery she kept Elsie employed with the
children, every now and then coming to look in on her
with excuses that were always transparently flimsy.</p>

<p>The tension in the atmosphere pervaded the whole house.</p>

<p>At last one afternoon, when Gladys and Sonnie were at
school, and Mrs. Woolley in the drawing-room with an
unexpected caller, Elsie and the doctor met upon the
stairs.</p>

<p>She knew that she was looking her worst, strained and
overwrought, and with the odd Japanese aspect of her
eyes and cheek-bones intensified. Even her hair felt limp
and unresilient.</p>

<p>She looked at the doctor rather piteously, envisaging
to herself her own unprepossessing appearance, and wishing
that she had at least powdered her face recently.</p>

<p>“Where’s Amy?”</p>

<p>“In the drawing-room, with a lady visitor.”</p>

<p>“Thank God! I’ve been hag-ridden for the last week.
What the devil’s up, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she murmured. “At least, I know Mrs.
Woolley’s been horrid to me lately, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“She has, has she?” he muttered furiously. “Here—come
in here.”</p>

<p>He drew her into the shelter of the nearest doorway.</p>

<p>“Elsie, I’m mad about you. This sort of thing can’t
go on—it’s simply hell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, someone’ll hear....”</p>

<p>“I don’t care who hears!” But he lowered his voice.
“I haven’t had a kiss from you for days—quick<i>!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Their lips met.</p>

<p>“You dear little girl! Is she being a beast to you?”</p>

<p>Elsie, in his embrace, started violently. “<i>Someone
coming upstairs!</i>” she hissed.</p>

<p>He stood motionless to listen, waited a second too long,
and then sharply shut the door.</p>

<p>“Florrie!” Elsie whispered in a frightened voice.
“Did she see us?”</p>

<p>“No, no—not a chance. Or, if she did, she only saw me.
She won’t think anything of that.”</p>

<p>“She’s gone upstairs—I must go.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t. I tell you it’s all right. Hang it, Elsie,
when am I going to get a word with you again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I think I shall go home again.”
She was half crying.</p>

<p>“Elsie, d’you know Amy’s going out to-morrow night?
She’s going to see her friend, that Williams woman, who’s
ill.”</p>

<p>“What, the one that was at mother’s place?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—but they’re in their own house now. It’ll
take her all the evening to get there and back, pretty nearly.”</p>

<p>“She won’t go.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she will. I shall tell her I’m going off to a case at
Roehampton or somewhere, and that I shan’t be back till
late.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t. It simply isn’t safe.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite safe, you little fool. You and me have got
to come to an understanding, I can’t stand this life another
minute. Look here, we’ll go out somewhere together.”</p>

<p>“No, no! That’d be much worse. Sonnie always wakes
up, and he’ll scream himself into a fit if I’m not there, and
then Florrie would know——”</p>

<p>“I forgot the kids. Elsie—Gladys sleeps in your room
doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Elsie, suddenly flushing scarlet.</p>

<p>He laughed abruptly, scanning her face with hungry eyes.
“I’ll have a fire in the surgery. We’ll go down there.
Florrie knows better than to put her foot inside it,” said
Doctor Woolley significantly.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h4>V</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was two days later.</p>

<p>Florrie and Mrs. Woolley were talking in the kitchen.
Elsie hung about in the diminutive passage, trying
desperately to hear what they were saying. An awful
intuition gripped her that they were talking of her.</p>

<p>Florrie’s voice was indistinct, almost inaudible, but
snatched phrases rose occasionally from the angry monotone
that was Mrs. Woolley’s.</p>

<p>“... My innocent children ... turn my back ...
the gutter ... don’t you talk to me ... the gutter ...
out of the gutter....”</p>

<p>Elsie tried wildly to persuade herself that Mrs. Woolley
was abusing Florrie. Sometimes she lost her temper with
her servants, and shouted at them.</p>

<p>On the evening that Mrs. Woolley had gone to see her
friend Mrs. Williams, who was reported very ill, Elsie, in
her best frock, had boldly gone into the surgery, where a fire
blazed, and there was a sofa newly piled with cushions.
On the table had been placed a bottle and glasses and a
dish of biscuits. Doctor Woolley had locked the door
behind her, in spite of Elsie’s half-meant protests, but at
first he had been entirely jovial, using catch-phrases that
had made her laugh, and drinking heartily.</p>

<p>She herself had begun to feel rather affronted and puzzled
at his aloofness, before it suddenly came to an end.</p>

<p>The remembrance of her own surrender rather bewildered
Elsie. She had never consciously made up her mind to it,
but the doctor’s urgency, her own physical susceptibility,
and an underlying, violent curiosity had proved far too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
strong for her feeble defences, based on timidity and on
the recollection of certain unexplained, and less-than-half-understood,
arbitrary axioms laid down during her childhood
by her mother.</p>

<p>She supposed that that one half-hour in the surgery had
made “a bad girl” of her, but the aspect of the case that
really preoccupied her was her terror that Mrs. Woolley
should have found it out.</p>

<p>She felt sick with fright as the kitchen door opened, and,
turning round, pretended to be looking for something in
the housemaid’s closet under the stairs.</p>

<p>She heard Mrs. Woolley brush past her and go into
the drawing-room, slamming the door violently behind
her.</p>

<p>Elsie, her knees shaking, went upstairs to fetch Gladys
and Sonnie and take them to their kindergarten.</p>

<p>She dawdled on the way back, being unwilling to go into
the house again, and alternately hoping and dreading that
the doctor would be at home for the midday meal.</p>

<p>At one o’clock, however, Mrs. Woolley and Elsie sat down
without him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woolley did not speak to Elsie. She kept on looking
at her, and then looking away again. Her hard face was
inscrutable, but Elsie noticed that her hands, manipulating
her knife and fork, shook slightly. The doctor came in
before the meal was over, jaunty and talkative.</p>

<p>“Hallo! Is this Wednesday, or Piccadilly, or what?
Which I mean to say is, has the cold meat stage been passed
and the rice pudding come on, or contrarywise?”</p>

<p>Elsie burst into nervous laughter, the strident sound of
which caused the doctor to glance at her sharply, and Mrs.
Woolley said:</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Herbert! The way you talk, sometimes!
The girl has got your meat and vegetables keeping hot in
the oven, and I’m sure you haven’t seen rice pudding at the
table for a fortnight. There’s a nice piece of cheese on the
side, too.”</p>

<p>The doctor ate in silence, voraciously, as he always did,
and his wife presently said in a thin, vicious voice:</p>

<p>“Of course, you’ve nothing to say to your wife, Herbert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
It’s easy enough to talk and be amusing with strangers,
isn’t it?—but I suppose it isn’t worth while in your own
home.”</p>

<p>“What’s up, Amy?” he growled. He did not look at
Elsie, who found herself fixing apprehensive eyes on him,
although she knew it was a betrayal.</p>

<p>“Why should anything be up, as you call it? But as
it isn’t very amusing for me to sit here all day while you eat,
and as I happen to be rather busy, strange though it may
seem, I think I’ll ask you to excuse me.”</p>

<p>She turned her head towards Elsie, but spoke without
looking at her. “I’ll thank you to come and find that
paper pattern for Gladys’s smock. The child isn’t fit to be
seen.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Woolley pushed Elsie out of the room in front of her,
making it obvious that she meant her to have no opportunity
of exchanging a look with the doctor.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon she never let the girl out of
her sight until Elsie had actually left the house to go and
fetch the two children from school.</p>

<p>It was abundantly evident that a crisis impended. The
atmospheric tension affected everyone in the house, and
Elsie, her nerves on edge, became frantic.</p>

<p>She said, immediately after supper, that she was tired,
and should go to bed, and Mrs. Woolley laughed, shortly and
sarcastically.</p>

<p>Elsie went up to her room and cried hysterically on her
bed until Gladys woke and began to whine enquiries.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible, to Elsie’s inexperience, that the
horrors of that day should repeat themselves, but the next
one was Sunday, and brought its own miseries.</p>

<p>The doctor, who did not go to church as a rule, announced
his intention of accompanying his family, and they set out,
a constrained procession: Gladys, in tight black boots and
with fair hair crimped round her shoulders, holding her
father’s hand, Mrs. Woolley, walking just a little faster
than was comfortable for Sonnie’s short legs, clutching the
boy’s hand, and Elsie slouching a pace or two behind, cold
and wretched.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the Crescent they met an elderly couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
who often came to see them, and whom Elsie knew well by
name as Mr. and Mrs. Loman.</p>

<p>The encounter broke up the procession, and caused a
readjustment of places. Mrs. Woolley was at once claimed
by the sallow, spectacled Mrs. Loman, and the children,
with shrill acclamations, ran to her husband, Sonnie’s
godfather and the purveyor of many small treats and
presents.</p>

<p>The doctor, after a loud and boisterous greeting, boldly
joined Elsie, and both of them dropped behind the others.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve wanted so to speak to you!” gasped Elsie.</p>

<p>“Shut up—don’t make a fuss now, there’s a good girl.
Keep a cheery face on you, for God’s sake, or we shall give
the show away worse than we’ve done already.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Woolley turned round. “Herbert, Mrs. Loman
is just saying that she hasn’t set eyes on you for ages.
Come and give an account of yourself.”</p>

<p>She spoke in a thin, artificial voice, but her eyes blazed
a command at him.</p>

<p>The doctor stared back at her, insolent security in his
manner. “Thankee, Amy, but I wouldn’t interrupt a
ladies’ confab. for the world. Go on about your sky-blue-purple
Sunday-go-to-meeting costumes, and I’ll keep
Elsie company.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Loman laughed and the doctor grinned back at her.</p>

<p>White patches had appeared on the mottled surface of
Mrs. Woolley’s face, but she made no rejoinder.</p>

<p>Doctor Woolley turned to Elsie again, the merriment
dropping from his manner. “That’ll shut her up for a
bit,” he said between his teeth. “Has she been giving you
gyp, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s been awful. I’m certain she’s found out.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“That Florrie, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Damn Florrie and her mischief-making! Well, kiddie,
the fat’s in the fire. I’m afraid there’s only one thing for
it.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, my dear child, don’t you see for yourself—you’ll
have to clear out of here. No use waiting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Amy to make a bloody row, now is there? If you simply
say you’re going home again, she won’t have a leg to
stand on. And if it wasn’t for—for the kids, I’d go with
you.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t,” said Elsie bitterly. “I may be a bit
green, but I’m not green enough to swallow that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like that,” said Doctor Woolley. He
slipped his hand under her arm, and at the contact, jaded
and miserable as she was, her pulses leapt. His fingers
squeezed her arm.</p>

<p>“We’ve had some happy times together, little girl, eh?”
he murmured in a sentimental voice. “And don’t you see
that when you’re on your own again we can meet ever so
much more freely. I want—you know what I want, don’t
you, Elsie?”</p>

<p>She did not respond. “What <i>I</i> want, is to know what’ll
happen to me if I go back to mother and say I’ve left Mrs.
Woolley. You don’t suppose she, and my sister and my
aunts, aren’t going to ask what’s happened, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, you can tell them something,” said the doctor
impatiently. “A clever girl like you, Elsie, surely you can
think of something. Besides, everybody knows that a
pretty girl doesn’t always hit it off with a woman older
than herself. There’s nothing wonderful in that. Damnation,
they’re stopping!”</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>He withdrew his arm hastily from hers after a final
pressure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woolley and her friend were already standing at
the church steps, and both of them fixed their eyes on
Elsie and the doctor as they came up. Elsie saw Mrs.
Woolley touch the other woman’s elbow, and guessed at,
rather than heard, the words coming from between her
teeth:</p>

<p>“Look at that, now—<i>look at that</i>.”</p>

<p>On Mrs. Loman’s face was an expression of mingled
eagerness, curiosity, and disgust. It was evident that
Mrs. Woolley had spoken freely of her wrongs.</p>

<p>Elsie spent her time in church in wondering whether it
would yet be possible to blunt Mrs. Woolley’s suspicions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
or whether she dared face her mother with a made-up
story to account for her return.</p>

<p>She was still young enough to have a furtive dread that
her mother must be omniscient in her regard, and she was
afraid that Mrs. Palmer would somehow guess at her lapse
and tax her with it.</p>

<p>Elsie had very often lied to her mother before, but not
with any conspicuous success, and she felt just now strangely
shaken and unnerved, physically and morally.</p>

<p>When they came out of church, the Lomans hospitably
pressed their friends to return with them, share the hot
Sunday dinner, and spend the afternoon. The children
were specifically included, but Mrs. Loman glanced
in Elsie’s direction, and then looked back at Mrs. Woolley,
raising her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“You’d better go and see your mother this afternoon,”
said Mrs. Woolley coldly. “Go home first and tell
Florrie we shall be out, and she can lock up the house and
go out for a bit herself. Tell her she must be back by five.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Elsie lifelessly.</p>

<p>She turned on her heel, when a sudden shout stopped her.</p>

<p>“Post those letters of mine, will you?” said Doctor
Woolley very loudly. “You’ll find them in”—he came
nearer to her—“<i>wait in till I come</i>,” he muttered almost
inaudibly, and rejoined his wife before Elsie had taken in
the meaning of his words. It came to her afterwards, and
the renewed sense of intrigue very slightly relieved the dull
misery pervading her.</p>

<p>At No. 8, Mortimer Crescent, the hot joint was taken out
of the oven and left to grow cold, but Florrie had made a
Yorkshire pudding, and she and Elsie ate it for their dinner,
and added pickles and bread and cheese and cake to the meal.
Very soon afterwards, Florrie announced that she was going
off at once.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Elsie. “I told <i>her</i> I’d lock up the house.
Mind you’re in by five.”</p>

<p>“That’s as it may be,” haughtily said Florrie, with a
venomous glance. Elsie felt far too tired to quarrel with
the maid, as she had often done before, and when Florrie
was actually gone she went upstairs and lay down on her bed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
It was nearly three o’clock before a cautious sound from
below betrayed the return of the doctor.</p>

<p>Elsie rose and automatically glanced at herself in the
looking-glass. One side of her face was flushed, her eyes
looked small and swollen-lidded, and her hair was disordered.
She dabbed powder on her face and pulled her
wave of hair further down over her forehead before going
downstairs.</p>

<p>The doctor was hanging up his hat on the crowded hooks
that lined one side of the wall in the tiny entrance lobby.</p>

<p>“Coast clear?”</p>

<p>Elsie nodded.</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely.” She held out the key of the house door.
“I’ve locked up at the back.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll lock up at the front,” said Doctor Woolley,
and did so.</p>

<p>“My God, we’re in a bloody mess,” he began, turning
round and facing Elsie.</p>

<p>Desperate, she ran forward and threw herself into his
arms, instinctively seeking the only reassurance she knew,
that of physical contact.</p>

<p>The doctor suddenly buried his face in her hair, then
forced her face upwards and kissed her passionately.</p>

<p>They clung to one another.</p>

<p>At last he released his clasp, only keeping one arm round
her waist.</p>

<p>“Where can we go? We’ll have to settle something, and
Lord knows when I shall get another chance of speaking to
you, with that hell-cat on the warpath. I’ve had the
deuce and all of a time getting here now, and we must both
clear out of the place before she and the kids get back.
Put on your hat and coat, old girl, and come along.”</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“Where I take you,” said the doctor brusquely.</p>

<p>When she came down again, he hurried her out of the
house, locking the door again behind them, and putting
the key under the scraper, where it was always looked for
on Sunday.</p>

<p>“Taxi!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>The doctor hailed a passing taxi and made Elsie get into it.</p>

<p>He gave the address of a hotel in a street of which she
had never heard.</p>

<p>“Where are we going to?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere where I can talk to you.”</p>

<p>He passed his arm round her again, and she made no
pretence of resistance, but lay against him, letting him
play with her hand and occasionally bend his head down to
kiss her lips.</p>

<p>Elsie had slept very little for the past three nights;
she had shed tears, and she had been subject to a continual
nervous strain. By the time that the taxi stopped she was
almost dozing, and it was in a half-dazed state that she
followed Dr. Woolley into the dingy hall of a high building
and, after a very short parley with a stout man in evening
dress, to an upstairs sitting-room.</p>

<p>She asked nothing better than to sink on to the narrow
couch in a corner of the room and let herself be petted and
caressed, but after a time her wearied senses awoke, and
told her that the man beside her was becoming restive and
excited.</p>

<p>“Look here, Elsie,” he said finally, “you’re a beguiling
little witch, you are—but we’ve got to come down to hard
facts. I’m going to order you a pick-me-up, and have one
myself, and then we can talk about what’s to be done next.
I’ve got to be home again, worse luck, by seven o’clock.
I’m supposed to have had an urgent call to Amy’s friend,
Mrs. Williams. She’s ill enough, poor soul, in all conscience,
and I’ll have to go there before I go home. Now
then, what’ll you have?”</p>

<p>“Tea,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>He laughed. “Women are all alike! You can have
your tea—poisonous stuff, tincture of tannin—and I’ll
order what I think’s good for you to go with it. Wait here
till I come back.”</p>

<p>He went out, and Elsie, already revived and stimulated,
flew to the spotted and discoloured looking-glass, and took
out her pocket-comb to rearrange her curls.</p>

<p>She actually enjoyed the hot, strong tea when it came,
and her spirits suddenly rose to a boisterous pitch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>They both laughed loudly at the faces that Elsie made
over the bottle that the doctor had obtained, and from which
he repeatedly helped himself and her, and although they
kept on telling one another that they must talk seriously,
their hilarity kept on increasing. At last he began to make
violent love to her, and Elsie responded coquettishly,
luring him on by glance and gesture, while her tongue
uttered glib and meaningless protests. Very soon, her
flimsy defences gave way altogether, and she had ceded
to him everything that he asked.</p>

<p>Then the inevitable reaction overtook her, and she cried,
and called herself a wicked girl, and finally sank limply into
a corner of the taxi that Dr. Woolley had summoned to the
door of the hotel.</p>

<p>He got in beside her. “Buck up, little girl!” he cried
urgently. “You’ll be at No. 8 in no time, and we don’t
want Amy asking awkward questions. Look here, I’ll put
you down at the corner of the Crescent, and you can walk
to the house. The air’ll do you good, and besides, we can’t
be seen together. I’m off to that wretched Williams woman,
and I’m not going to be in till late.”</p>

<p>Elsie continued to sob.</p>

<p>“Come, come, come—pull yourself to pieces,” Doctor
Woolley tried to make her laugh. “We’ve not settled
anything, but we’ve had our time together. Ah, a little
love is a great thing in a world like this one, Elsie. Thank
you for being so sweet to me, little girl.”</p>

<p>He kissed her hastily, with a perfunctoriness of which she
was aware.</p>

<p>When the taxi stopped in the main thoroughfare, a little
way before the turning into Mortimer Crescent, he almost
shoved her on to the pavement.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget—you’ve been out ever since dinner-time,
and you imagine me to have been in the buzzim of my
family enjoying back chat with the old Lomans. Don’t
say anything about that, though, unless you’re asked.
Tell the man to drive like blazes now, will you?”</p>

<p>Elsie mechanically obeyed.</p>

<p>Then she dragged herself to No. 8. Her ring was
answered by Florrie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>The little servant girl was grinning maliciously. “She’s
in the d—’s own temper and all, and you’re going to catch
it hot and strong for leaving her to put the children to
bed.”</p>

<p>“Mind your own business, Florrie,” said Elsie, pushing
past her.</p>

<p>She affected not to hear the single word that the servant
flung at her back, but it made her wince.</p>

<p>In the bedroom she found Gladys already in bed, wide
awake.</p>

<p>“Mother put us to bed. She was awfully cross, and
she slapped Sonnie twice and me once.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, because I whined, she said. And she slapped
Sonnie when he told her about Dadda being so funny with
you. You didn’t know we <i>saw</i> one day,” giggled Gladys.</p>

<p>“Saw what?”</p>

<p>“One day when Dadda kissed you and Sonnie and I saw,
over the banisters, and we laughed, but you didn’t hear
us.”</p>

<p>“You little viper!” muttered Elsie between her teeth.
“I’d like to kill you, I would.”</p>

<p>Gladys alternately giggled and whined, and Elsie was
quite unable to distinguish whether the child was really
malicious or simply amused by something to which she
attached no meaning.</p>

<p>“Anyway, if she’s told her mother, it’s all up,” thought
Elsie.</p>

<p>She saw that there was nothing for it but to leave Mortimer
Crescent, and spent a miserable night wondering what to
say to her mother and sister.</p>

<p>At midnight she heard the sound of the doctor’s key in
the front door and his heavy foot on the stairs. He paused
outside her door for some seconds, then she heard him go
into his wife’s room.</p>

<p>Elsie tossed about in her narrow bed. Her present
dilemma frightened her, and she had a vague, irrational idea
that some awful and horrible penalty always descended sooner
or later upon girls who had done as she had done. These
fears, and her lack of any vivid imagination, had dulled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
her emotional susceptibilities, and she scarcely felt regret
at the thought of no longer seeing the doctor. He now
stood to her for the symbol of an assuaged desire, the
fulfilment of which had brought about her present
miseries. Nevertheless, at the back of her consciousness
was latent the conviction that never again would she be
satisfied with the clumsy demonstrations and meaningless
contacts of her intercourse with the boys and youths whom
she had known at home.</p>

<p>It seemed to her next morning that she was wholly ugly.
Her complexion looked sodden and her eyes were nearly
invisible. Her mouth, in some odd way, seemed to have
swollen. No one could have called her pretty, and to
anyone who had seen her in good looks she would have been
almost unrecognisable. Mrs. Woolley, coming downstairs
at ten o’clock, eyed her with a malignant satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she said, “you won’t be altogether surprised
to hear that I’m going to make some changes. You’d
better pack your box, and go home to your mother, I
think.”</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you that I couldn’t stay on here any
longer,” said Elsie swiftly. “The ways of the house aren’t
what I’ve been used to, Mrs. Woolley.”</p>

<p>In a flash, Mrs. Woolley had turned nasty, and Elsie had
seen her own unwisdom.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t they indeed? Perhaps you’d be so kind as
to tell me what you are used to—or shall <i>I</i> tell <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>Then she suddenly raised her voice almost to a scream and
poured out a torrent of abuse and invective, and the two
children crept in from the hall and began to cry, and to make
faces at Elsie, and demonstrations of hitting her with their
little hands, and the servant Florrie held the door half
open, so that she might see and hear it all.</p>

<p>Elsie screamed back again at Mrs. Woolley, but she had
neither the fluency nor the determination of the older
woman, and she was unable to prevent herself from bursting
into tears and sobs.</p>

<p>Finally Mrs. Woolley drove her out of the room, standing
at the foot of the stairs while Elsie ran up to pull on her
best hat and coat, and forbidding the children to follow her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Don’t go near her, my pets—she’s a wicked girl, that’s
what she is—not fit to be in the same house as innocent
little children. Now then, out you go, miss, before I send
for the police.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Elsie, shaking from head to foot, “and
I’ll never set foot in your filthy house again. And I’ll
send for my trunk and for every penny you owe me, and I’ll
have the law on you for insinuations on my character.”</p>

<p>Then she dashed out of the house and into the street.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<h4>VI</h4>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie’s</span> return home caused far less sensation than she had
feared. Mrs. Palmer, indeed, was very angry, but principally
at Elsie’s folly in having come away without her trunk
or the money due to her.</p>

<p>When a week had elapsed, and nothing had come from
Mortimer Crescent, Mrs. Palmer declared her intention of
going to a solicitor.</p>

<p>“However you could be such a fool, young Elsie—and I
don’t half understand what happened, even now. What
was the row about?”</p>

<p>Elsie had decided upon a half-truth. “Oh, she was a
jealous old fool, and couldn’t bear her hubby to look the
same side of the room as anyone else. That’s all it was,
really. She spoke to me very rudely, I consider—in fact
she was decidedly insulting—so I simply up and said:
‘Mrs. Woolley,’ I said, ‘that’s not the way I’m accustomed
to be spoken to,’ I said, ‘and what’s more I won’t stand it.’
Quite quietly, I said it, looking her very straight in the
face. ‘I won’t stand it,’ I said, quite quietly. That did
for her. She didn’t know how to take it at all. But, of
course, I wasn’t going to stay in the house a moment after
that, and I simply walked straight upstairs and put on my
things and left her there. She knows what I think of her,
though.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she knows what she thinks of you,” remarked
Mrs. Palmer shrewdly, “and it probably isn’t so far out,
either. She may be jealous as you say—those fleshy women
often are, when their figures come to be a perpetual worry, so
to speak—but there’s no smoke without a fire, and I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
you, Elsie Palmer. I suppose this doctor fellow was for
ever giving you sweets and wanting to take you out at
nights, and sit next you in the ’bus coming home, with his
wife on the other side of him as like as not. You were a
young fool, let me tell you, to lose a good place like that for
a man who can’t be any use to you. What you want to
look out for is a husband. I shan’t have a minute’s peace
about you till you’re married.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Elsie, rather gratified, and very curious.</p>

<p>“Never you mind why. Because Mother says so, and
that’s enough. Now you can get on your hat and come
with me to Mr. Williams’ office and see what he can do to
get this trunk of yours away from that woman. She’s no
lady, as I saw plainly the very first time I ever laid eyes
on her.”</p>

<p>On the way to the City, Mrs. Palmer questioned Elsie
rather half-heartedly. “You’ve not been a bad girl in
any way while you’ve been away from Mother, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. I don’t know what you mean,”
Elsie declared, sick with sudden fright.</p>

<p>“I should hope you didn’t. Because mind, Elsie, any
gurl of mine who disgraced herself wouldn’t get any help
from <i>me</i>. And though I don’t object to a bit of fun while
a gurl’s young, skylarking may lead to other things. I hope
there’s no need for me to speak any plainer. I’ve brought
you gurls up innocent, and I intend you shall remain so.
Not that Geraldine’s ever given me a moment’s worry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Geraldine!” Elsie was profoundly relieved at
seeing an opportunity for changing the subject indirectly.
“She’s a sheep.”</p>

<p>“You’ve no call to speak like that of your elder sister,
miss. I wish you were half as steady as she is. She’s the
one to help her widowed mother, for all she has such poor
health.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose is the matter with her, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Bile,” said Mrs. Palmer laconically. “Your father
was the same, but it doesn’t matter so much in a man.”</p>

<p>“Why ever not?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t interfere with his prospects. Now I often
think Geraldine won’t ever get a husband, simply because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of the bad colour she sometimes goes, and the way her breath
smells. She can’t help it, poor gurl.”</p>

<p>Elsie felt contemptuous, rather than compassionate.
When they came to the office, a very young clerk, who stared
hard at Elsie, explained that Mr. Williams was away. He
had suffered a family bereavement.</p>

<p>“His wife?” gasped Mrs. Palmer, greatly excited.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say that Mrs. Williams died yesterday
morning. Mr. Williams was not at the office, and a telephone
message came through later to the head clerk, giving
the melancholy intelligence. I believe Mrs. Williams had
been ill for some time.”</p>

<p>“Why, goodness me, we knew her ever so well, my
daughter and I! They stayed with us in the autumn....
Elsie, fancy poor Mrs. Williams dying!”</p>

<p>“Fancy!”</p>

<p>“Would you care to see the head clerk, Mr. Cleaver,
madam?” said the youth politely, still gazing at Elsie.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I think I’d better. He may be able to tell us
something more, Elsie,” cried Mrs. Palmer gloatingly.</p>

<p>But when the clerk had gone away to see whether Mr.
Cleaver was disengaged, Mrs. Palmer remarked to her
daughter:</p>

<p>“Not that he’ll be able to say much, naturally not.
It’s an awkward subject to enter on at all with a gentleman,
poor Mrs. Williams being in the condition she was.”</p>

<p>“I heard Doctor Woolley say she was very ill.”</p>

<p>“It’s a funny thing, Elsie, but many a time I’ve felt
a presentiment like. I’ve looked at Mrs. Williams, and
seen death in her face. And that Nellie Simmons, she told
me she’d had a most peculiar dream about Mrs. Williams
one night. Saw her lying all over blood, she said, and it
quite scared her. I knew then what it meant, though I
told Nellie not to be a silly gurl. But dreams can’t lie,
as they say, not if they’re a certain sort.”</p>

<p>Elsie shuddered, as a thrill of superstitious terror went
through her. Dreams played a large part in her life, and
Mrs. Palmer had always shown her children that she
“believed in dreams,” especially in those of a <i>macabre</i> nature.</p>

<p>The young clerk came back, and took them into a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
room where a bald-headed, pale-faced man sat at a writing-table.
Mrs. Palmer’s delicacy ran no risk of affront from
him, for he was monosyllabic on the subject of Mrs.
Williams’ death, and only said that Mr. Williams would
not be back until the following week.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer, looking disappointed, launched into a
voluble story of Elsie’s trunk and its non-return.</p>

<p>Mr. Cleaver said that the firm would write a letter to Mrs.
Woolley that evening. He seemed disinclined to enlarge
on that, or any other subject.</p>

<p>“It’s been a great worry, as you can imagine,” Mrs.
Palmer said, reluctant to terminate an interview which was
anyhow to cost her money. “However the girl could have
been so silly, I don’t know. But we mustn’t look for old
heads on young shoulders, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p>For the first time, Mr. Cleaver glanced at Elsie as though
he really saw her. “Your young lady will be looking for
another post, no doubt?”</p>

<p>“By-and-by,” said Mrs. Palmer with a sudden languor.
“I’m afraid if I had my way, Mr. Cleaver, I’d keep both
my girlies at home with their mother. And this one’s my
baby, too. I really only let her go to that Mrs. Woolley
to oblige poor Mrs. Williams, who was a dear friend of mine.
My daughter has been trained for the shorthand-typing,
really, haven’t you, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“’M.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, Mrs. Palmer, the letter shall go off to-night,
and I am very much mistaken if the lady does
not——”</p>

<p>“Don’t call her a lady, Mr. Cleaver. She’s no——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer had said all this before, and Mr. Cleaver held
open the door for her, and compelled her to pass through it
before she had time to say it all over again.</p>

<p>Elsie and Mrs. Palmer were in the omnibus that was to
take them back to their own suburb very much earlier than
they had expected to be.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, we’ll stop at the corner shop and
have a wreath sent in time for the funeral. I’ve got some
money on me,” said Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>They chose a wreath and were given a black-edged card
upon which Mrs. Palmer inscribed the address of Mr.
Williams and: “With true sympathy and every kind
thought from Mrs. Gerald Palmer, Miss Palmer and Miss
Elsie Palmer.”</p>

<p>“I’d meant to say a few very sharp words to them about
introducing <i>that</i> Mrs. Woolley to me, and persuading me to
let you go to her, but of course, it’ll have to be let drop now.
I daresay poor Mrs. Williams was taken in by the woman
herself.”</p>

<p>For two or three days Elsie lounged about at home, obliged
by her mother to help in the house, but spending as much time
as she could with Irene Tidmarsh, whose old father was still
living, although suffering from incurable disease. Sometimes
when Elsie and Irene were gossiping in the dining-room,
they would hear the old man roaring with pain overhead,
and then Irene would run up to him, administer a drug,
and come down again looking rather white. A desiccated
spinster aunt made occasional appearances, and took
Irene’s place whilst Irene went to the cinema with Elsie.
But Irene never mentioned Arthur Osborne, and Elsie
saw neither him nor his brother.</p>

<p>She told herself that she did not care, and that she was
sick of men and their beastly ways.</p>

<p>She one evening repeated this sentiment to Geraldine,
whom she suspected of disbelieving her version of the quarrel
with Mrs. Woolley.</p>

<p>“So you say. I s’pose that’s because there isn’t anyone
after you. If that Begg boy turned up again, or Johnnie
Osborne or any of them, you’d sing quite a different song.”</p>

<p>“You’re jealous,” said Elsie candidly.</p>

<p>Her sister laughed shrilly. “That’s a good one, young
Elsie. Me jealous of a kid like you! I should like to know
what for? Why, you’re not even pretty.”</p>

<p>The taunt enraged Elsie, because she knew that it was
true, and that she was not really pretty. What she did not
yet realise was that she would always be able to make men
think her so.</p>

<p>“Your trunk’s come, Elsie,” Mrs. Palmer screamed at
the door. “Carter Paterson brought it, carriage to pay, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
<i>course</i>. You’d better see there’s nothing missing out of it.”</p>

<p>Elsie made a perfunctory examination, noticing nothing
but that there was a letter lying just under the newspaper
spread over her untidily packed belongings.</p>

<p>“It’s all right.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer had gone back into the kitchen again, and
Elsie, who did not care what Geraldine thought of her,
pulled out the note and read it. It was from Doctor
Woolley, as she had expected.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Own Dear Little Girlie</span>,</p>

<p>“What a rotten world it is, kiddie, and what a
shame you being turned away like that. Believe me, dear
little girlie, if I had been at home it would never have
happened. Now, Elsie, you and I have had a very nice
friendship, and I know you will understand what I mean if
I say that it must come to an end <i>for the present</i>. Burn this
letter, dear, won’t you, and don’t answer it on any account.
The letters that come for me to this house are not safe from
interference, so you see what trouble it might make. With
all best wishes for your future, and thanking you for your
sweet friendship, which I shall never forget,</p>

<p class="right">“Yours, &#160; &#160;<br>

“H.”</p>
</div>

<p>“The cad!” said Elsie disgustedly.</p>

<p>She had not really expected Doctor Woolley to write to
her at all, although there had been in her mind a vague
anticipation of seeing him again very soon. But the letter,
with its perfunctory endearments and cautionary injunctions,
suddenly made it clear to her that the whole episode
of their relationship was at an end.</p>

<p>“The swine,” said Elsie, although without violent
emotion of any kind.</p>

<p>She felt that life, for the moment, was meaningless, but
rather from the familiar and sordid surroundings of her
home, and from her own listlessness and fatigue, than from
the defection of Doctor Woolley.</p>

<p>It failed to excite her when a letter arrived for Mrs.
Palmer, from the office of Mr. Williams and written by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
himself, saying how much he regretted that Mrs. Woolley,
the merest acquaintance of his dear late wife, should have
failed to make Miss Elsie happy in her house. If Miss Elsie
desired to find an appointment in the clerical line, as he
understood, then Mr. Williams would be most happy to
make a suggestion. Could Mrs. Palmer, with Miss Elsie,
make it convenient to call at the office any afternoon that
week?</p>

<p>“He may want to take you into his own office, Elsie, as
like as not. He’d feel he ought to do something, I expect,
considering they sent you to those people, those Woolleys,
as they call themselves, in the first place.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I want to go into an office, Mother.”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Elsie, let me and you understand one
another,” said Mrs. Palmer with great determination.
“I’ve had enough of your wants and don’t wants, my lady.
One word more, and you’ll get a smack-bottom just exactly
as you got when you were in pinafores, and don’t you
forget it. If you think you’re going to live at home, no
more use in the house than a sick headache, and wasting
your time running round with God-knows-who, then I can
tell you you’ve never made a bigger mistake in your life.
Off you pop this directly minute, and get on your hat, and
come with me to Mr. Williams. If he’s heard of a job for
you, we’ll get it settled at once.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Geraldine bitterly, “I’ll have to see
to the teas and everything else, while you’re out. It seems
to me it’s always Elsie that’s being thought about, and sent
here, and taken there, and the rest of it.”</p>

<p>“More shame for her,” said Mrs. Palmer sombrely.
“I declare to goodness I don’t know how I’m to face your
aunties next time they come here, unless there’s something
been settled about Elsie. I’m sick and tired of being told
I spoil that girl.”</p>

<p>“Whatever job she gets, she’ll be home in a month,”
said Geraldine.</p>

<p>“She’ll get something she won’t relish from me if she
is,” Mrs. Palmer retorted. She pinned on her hat and
pulled a pair of shiny black kid gloves out of a drawer in the
kitchen dresser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Elsie, rather sulky and unwilling, was obliged to follow
her mother once more to the dingy office, but it cheered
her to see the pleased, furtive smile on the face of the young
clerk who had admitted them before. It was very evident
that he had not forgotten her. Elsie thought more about
him than about the desiccated, wooden-faced little solicitor,
with the crêpe band round his arm, who responded to all
Mrs. Palmer’s voluble condolence with solemn little bows
and monosyllables.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer was evidently disappointed at extracting
from him no details about his wife’s illness and death, and
at last she turned the subject and began to speak of Elsie’s
qualifications as a typist.</p>

<p>“You see, Mr. Williams, I always felt it was waste, her
going to be a kind of mother’s help to that Mrs. Woolley.
‘It’s not what you’ve been trained for, my dear,’ I said, ‘but
still, if you want to, you shall try it for a bit.’ I’ve always
been a one to let my girlies try their own wings, Mr. Williams.
‘The old home nest is waiting for you when you’re
tired of it,’ is what I always say. You’ve heard mother
tell you that many and many a time, haven’t you,
Elsie?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Elsie, bored.</p>

<p>She had often heard her mother make the like statements,
in order to impress strangers, and she had no objection
to backing her up, since it was far less trouble to do so
than to have a “row” afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams bowed again. “I am sorry that Miss
Elsie was exposed to unpleasantness of any sort, through an
introduction of mine, and I may add that I entirely agree
with you, Mrs. Palmer, in thinking that the—the domestic
duties embarked upon were quite unworthy of her. Now,
I am in want of a confidential clerk in this office.”</p>

<p>Elsie saw her mother’s eyes glistening behind the coarse
fibre of her mended veil, and felt that her fate was sealed.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Williams?”</p>

<p>“If I could persuade you to allow Miss Elsie to come to
me.... Nine to six, and twenty-five shillings a week to
begin with. Her duties would be light, simply to take down,
type, and file my personal letters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“It would be a very good beginning for her,” said Mrs.
Palmer, firmly, but with no undue enthusiasm. Elsie knew
that her mother’s mind was quite made up, but that she
did not want to seem eager in the eyes of Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“You’d like to give it a trial, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Elsie. She met the eyes of Mr.
Williams and managed to smile at him, and for an instant
it seemed to her that an answering pin-point of light appeared
behind the pince-nez.</p>

<p>“It would be quite usual,” said Mr. Williams gravely,
“for me to give you a short test. Take this pencil and
paper, please, and take this down.”</p>

<p>He handed Elsie a shorthand pad and a pencil. She took
down in shorthand the brief business letter that he dictated
to her, and then, more nervously, read it aloud,
stumbling over the pronunciation of one or two words, and
once substituting one word for another, of which the shorthand
outlines were similar, without any perception of the
bearing of either upon the context.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams corrected her. “It’s always the same,” he
told Mrs. Palmer in a low, rather melancholy voice. “These
young people are wonderfully clever at taking dictation—eighty
words a minute, a hundred words a minute—but
you can’t depend upon them to transcribe correctly.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer looked offended. “I’m sure Elsie will tell
you that she wasn’t doing herself justice, Mr. Williams. I’m
sure she’s as accurate as anybody, when she’s not nervous.
But if you think she won’t do the work well enough, of
course....”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer’s lips were drawn together, and her intonation
had become acidulated.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Mr. Williams quietly, “not at all.
You misunderstand my meaning altogether. I have no
doubt that Miss Elsie will suit me very well indeed, when
she has fallen into my little routine. What about next
week?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Mrs. Palmer answered swiftly. “I’ll let
her come to you on Monday morning, Mr. Williams, and
I’m very much obliged to you for thinking of us. It’ll
be a relief to me to know Elsie is in a good post. You see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
I’m in the position of both father and mother to my girlies,
and this one’s my baby, as I always say——”</p>

<p>As Mr. Williams opened the door for them he said: “I
hope that little affair about the trunk was satisfactorily
concluded? It was perhaps a shade awkward, having the
letter written from this office, in view of the fact that we
were personally acquainted with the parties—but my head
clerk, Mr. Cleaver, could hardly be expected to appreciate
that.... A very worthy man indeed, and an able one,
but the finer shades are rather beyond him. Good morning,
Mrs. Palmer—good morning, Miss Elsie. Nine o’clock on
Monday morning, then.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer went away in high spirits, and commented to
Elsie and to Geraldine so enthusiastically upon Elsie’s good
fortune, that she began to believe in it herself.</p>

<p>“Are there any other girls there?” Geraldine asked.</p>

<p>And Elsie said quickly, “Oh dear, no! Both the other
clerks are men.”</p>

<p>She began to think that perhaps after all the hours
spent in the office might not be without amusement.</p>

<p>Besides, all sorts of people came to see a solicitor.</p>

<p>Elsie spent the week-end in cutting out and making for
herself a blue crêpe blouse, which she intended to wear on
Monday morning. She also made a pair of black alpaca
sleeves, with elastic at the wrist and at the elbow, to be
drawn on over the blouse while she was working.</p>

<p>She put the sleeves, her shorthand pad and pencil, a
powder-puff, mirror, pocket-comb, and a paper-covered
novel in a small attaché case on Monday morning, pulled
on the rakish black velvet tam-o’-shanter, and went off to
Mr. Williams’ office.</p>

<p>Her first day there was marked by two discoveries:
that Mr. Williams expected to be called “sir” in office
hours, and that the name of the youth who shared with her
a small outer room where clients waited, or left messages,
was Fred Leary.</p>

<p>A high partition of match-boarding separated the waiting-room
from an inner office where Mr. Cleaver sat. And if
Elsie and Fred Leary spoke more than a very few words to
one another, Mr. Cleaver would tap imperatively against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the wood with a ruler. He was also apt to walk noiselessly
round the partition and stand there, silently watching Elsie,
if the sound of her typewriter ceased for any undue length
of time.</p>

<p>She learnt from Fred Leary that there had never been a
female typist in the office before, and that Mr. Cleaver had
been greatly opposed to the introduction of one.</p>

<p>“The Old Man always gets his way in the end, though,”
said Fred Leary, alluding to Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“I knew him before,” Elsie asserted, to give herself
importance. “Him and his wife were in our house for a
bit. I knew Mrs. Williams too.”</p>

<p>“They said he led her a life,” remarked Leary.</p>

<p>“What sort of way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t tell a kid like you.”</p>

<p>“What rubbish! As though I didn’t know as much as
you, any day.”</p>

<p>He laughed loudly. “Girls always think they know
everything, but they don’t—not unless some fellow has——”</p>

<p>The sharp tap of Mr. Cleaver’s pencil sounded against
the matchboard, and silenced them.</p>

<p>The fact that their conversations had to be more or less
clandestine added zest to them, and although Elsie was not
in any way attracted by young Leary, who was spotty and
unwholesome-looking, she several times went to a cinema with
him on Saturday afternoons, and once to a football match.
After the latter entertainment, however, they quarrelled.</p>

<p>Elsie had disliked the mud, the cold, the noise, the standing
about and the crowds. She had been bored by Leary’s
enthusiasm, which was utterly incomprehensible to her,
and secretly annoyed because, of the multitude of men
surrounding her, not one had paid any attention to her, or
to anything but the game and the players.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t struck on that outing of yours,” she remarked
critically to her escort the following Monday morning.
“Another time we’ll give the football matches a miss,
thank you.”</p>

<p>Leary’s admiration for Elsie, however, was less strong
than his desire to see a league match, and he offended her
by going by himself to the entertainment that she despised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Elsie resented his defection less for his own sake than
for that of the excitement that she could only experience
through flirtation, and without which she found her life
unbearably tedious.</p>

<p>She had been in the office nearly three months when Mr.
Williams asked her suddenly if she liked the work there.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind it,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>She was in reality perfectly indifferent to it, and merely
went through the day’s routine without active dislike, as
without intelligence.</p>

<p>“Now that you are used to our ways,” said Mr. Williams
deliberately, “I think you had better remove your table into
my room. The sound of your machine will not disturb
me in the least, and if clients desire a private interview,
you can retire.”</p>

<p>Elsie looked up, astonished, and met her employer’s
eyes.</p>

<p>His face was impassive as ever, but there was a faint,
covetous gleam in his fish-like eyes.</p>

<p>Elsie, at once repelled and fascinated, gazed back at him,
and felt her heart beginning to beat faster with a nervous
and yet pleasurable anticipation.</p>

<h4>VII</h4>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">When</span> do you want to take your holiday, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“I’m not particular.”</p>

<p>“Your mother will want you to get a breath of sea-air,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Elsie. “Mother’s not awfully
struck on going away.”</p>

<p>It was late July, and between Elsie and her employer
a curious, secret relationship had been established, at
present only symbolised by occasional furtive touches of
his hand on her neck or her dress, and a continual exchange
of glances, steady and compelling on Williams’s side, and
responded to by Elsie almost against her own will.</p>

<p>Her typewriting table had been moved into his office,
and she sat there nearly all day.</p>

<p>He spoke to her very little, but she was now always
intensely conscious of his presence, and of her own effect
upon him.</p>

<p>At first she did not understand to what his questions
about the holidays were leading.</p>

<p>Next day, he spoke about them again.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t you like to go to Brighton—some place like
that?”</p>

<p>“Rather.”</p>

<p>“I often run down there myself from Saturday to
Monday.”</p>

<p>Mr. Williams looked at her more attentively than ever,
and Elsie felt the blood creep up into her face. She knew
that she blushed easily and deeply, and that men enjoyed
seeing her blush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“That hasn’t got anything to do with me,” she stammered,
at once excited and confused.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Williams!”</p>

<p>He glanced cautiously at the door, and then lowered his
voice. “Look here, my dear child, I’m old enough to be
your father and—and my dear late wife took quite a fancy
to you. Surely you and I understand one another well
enough to take a little holiday jaunt together without anyone
but our two selves being any the wiser.”</p>

<p>Elsie had not really expected the suggestion, and she
was startled, but also triumphant.</p>

<p>“Whatever do you mean, Mr. Williams?”</p>

<p>He smiled, a small, thin-lipped smile, that held a
suggestion of cynical mockery at her transparent
pretence.</p>

<p>“Only what I say. I’m a poor, lonely fellow, with a
little bit of money and no one to spend it on, and if I go
to a nice hotel for the week-end I want someone to keep
me company. Think over it, Elsie. You quite understand
that I’m not asking anything of you—you’re as safe with
me as if I were your father. Just a pretty face opposite
me at meals, and a smartly dressed little companion to take
out for a walk on the front or to the theatre on Saturday
night—that’s all I want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>His face stiffened, and she felt immediately that she had
made a mistake.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully kind of you to think of such a thing, Mr.
Williams, but I really couldn’t dream of it. Why, I don’t
know what mother would think——”</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s a very conventional world,” said Mr.
Williams gravely. “You and I would know well enough
that our little adventure was most innocent, but we don’t
want anyone to think or say otherwise. So I propose,
Elsie, that we should keep it to ourselves. I presume it
would be easy to tell your mother that you were staying
with a friend?”</p>

<p>“Well—there’s Ireen Tidmarsh, a young lady I often go
with. I could say I was going to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Just so. After all, you’re of an age to manage your
own affairs.”</p>

<p>Elsie swelled with gratified vanity. She loved to be told
that she was grown up.</p>

<p>“Well, what about the August Bank Holiday week-end?
I could meet you at the booking office at Victoria Station
on the Saturday, and we could travel back together on the
Tuesday morning. I’d like to show you something of life,
Elsie.”</p>

<p>He moistened his lips with his tongue as he spoke the
words.</p>

<p>Elsie wished desperately that she could feel attracted by
him, as she had been by Doctor Woolley. But Mr.
Williams, physically, rather revolted her.</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t!” she repeated faintly.</p>

<p>He was very patient. “No expense, of course. And if
you’d like a new hat or an evening frock, Elsie, or a pretty
set of those silk things that girls wear underneath, why, I
hope you’ll let me have the privilege of providing them.
You can choose what you like and bring me the bill—only go
to a West End shop. Nothing shoddy.”</p>

<p>Elsie was breathless at his munificence, and she longed
wildly for the evening dress, and the silk underwear.
Pale pink crêpe....</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be worth it.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you wouldn’t ask me to do anything that
wasn’t perfectly right, Mr. Williams,” she said demurely.</p>

<p>“I am glad you feel that. I’m glad you trust me,” he
solemnly replied.</p>

<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s our secret. We need take no one into our
confidence, Elsie, you understand. The arrangement is a
perfectly innocent and natural little pleasure that you and
I are going to share, but people are very often coarse-minded
and censorious, and I would not wish to expose either of us
to unpleasant comments. You’ll remember that, and keep
it to yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>That night as she was going to bed, she critically examined
her own underwear. Her chemise and drawers were coarse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
she wore no stays, and the garters that held up her transparent
lisle-thread stockings were plain bands of grimy white
elastic. Her short petticoat was white, with a torn flounce,
and only the camisole, which showed beneath her transparent
blouses, was trimmed with imitation Valenciennes
lace and threaded with papery blue ribbons.</p>

<p>“What you doing, Elsie?” grumbled Geraldine from
her bed. “Get into bed, do; I want to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen those things they sell in sets, Geraldine,
in some of the High Street shops? Sort of silk combinations
and a princess petticoat and nightgown, all to match
like?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen them advertised at sale times, in the illustrateds,
and beastly indecent they are, too. Why, you can
see right through that stuff they’re made of.”</p>

<p>Elsie became very thoughtful.</p>

<p>Her sister’s words had brought before her mind’s eye an
involuntary picture that both startled and repelled her.</p>

<p>“Anyway, the prices are something wicked. What’s
up, young Elsie?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I heard something to-day that set me
wondering, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some girl that wanted a pink silk rig-out, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“You must have some queer friends. No decent girl
would wear those things—only tarts do, unless it’s fine
ladies that aren’t any better than they should be, from
what the Society papers say.”</p>

<p>Geraldine, in her curling-pins and her thick nightgown,
looked rigidly virtuous. “Get into bed, do.”</p>

<p>“It’s too hot,” sighed Elsie.</p>

<p>The room was like a furnace, but neither of them would
have dreamed of opening the window after dark.</p>

<p>Elsie tossed and turned about for a long while, unable
to sleep. She visualised herself in new clothes, in evening
dress, which she had never worn, and she thought of the
excitement of staying in a big hotel where there would very
likely be a band in the evenings and, of course, late dinner
every night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>If only it had been anyone but Mr. Williams! But then,
he was the only rich man she knew.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame,” thought Elsie, “that I shouldn’t have
opportunities of meeting other men like him, only different.
I wish I’d gone in for manicure—I’d have met all
sorts then.”</p>

<p>For a moment she wondered whether her friendship with
Williams might not lead to his introducing her to his
wealthy friends, but she was shrewd enough to perceive that
his first preoccupation would be to keep their connection
secret, and that he was of far too cautious a temperament
to risk her meeting with men younger and more attractive
than himself.</p>

<p>Her last waking thought was of the silk set of underclothes,
cool and lovely and transparent against her
skin.</p>

<p>The following morning Mr. Williams behaved exactly
as usual, and made no reference whatever to his suggestion
of a holiday. Elsie, rather anxious and affronted, took
advantage of a late call from a client to leave the office at
six o’clock exactly, without returning into her employer’s
room to announce her departure as she usually did.</p>

<p>On her way to the crowded Tube station she was followed
and accosted by a strange man. This adventure had
become a common one to Elsie, but a certain recklessness
pervaded her that evening, and when he urged her to come
and sit in the park, under the cool of the trees, she went with
him. He was a man of thirty-five or so, with a miserable,
haunted, disease-ravaged face, and he began almost at
once to pour out to her a long story of his wife’s treachery,
of which he had just made the discovery.</p>

<p>“I’ve never looked at another girl,” he kept on saying.
“I’ve never spoken to one the way I’ve spoken to you
to-night. But you remind me of her, in a way, and I
knew you’d be all right, and sorry for a poor devil who’s
been fooled.”</p>

<p>Elsie hardly listened to him, but she let him put his arm
round her waist, and as his caresses became more violent
and eager, she again felt that instinctive conviction that it
was to such an end that she had been created. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
physical contacts only, brought her to the fullness of self-expression.
At last she realised that her companion was
muttering a request that he might go home with her.</p>

<p>“What do you take me for?” Elsie asked furiously.
“I’m a respectable girl, I am.”</p>

<p>He became maudlin and begged her to forgive him, and
she sank back again into his embrace, appeased at once.</p>

<p>At last, when the park gates were closing, she roused
herself and insisted that if he wanted to go on talking to her
they must go somewhere and have supper.</p>

<p>The man seemed too dazed and wretched to understand
her, but when Elsie, rendered prudent by certain previous
experiences, asked whether he had any money, he drew
out a handful of loose silver.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then,” she said, relieved, and took him
to a cheap and very popular restaurant.</p>

<p>Elsie drank cocoa and ate sweet cakes, and her escort,
leaning heavily on the marble-topped table, continued his
low, maundering recitation of self-pity.</p>

<p>She had very little idea of what he was talking about.</p>

<p>She liked the restaurant and enjoyed her cakes, and the
occasional contact between herself and the unknown man
satisfied her for the time being.</p>

<p>When they left the restaurant, Elsie directed him to the
omnibus that would take her nearest to her own suburb,
and they climbed to the top of it, and sat in close proximity
on the narrow seat all through the long drive.</p>

<p>It was with real difficulty that she tore herself away in
the end, physically roused to a pitch that rapidly amounted
to torment. She was frightened and disgusted by her own
sensations, but much less so than she had been in the days of
her technical innocence, before she had known Doctor
Woolley. She decided that she would go to Brighton with
Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>And she would buy the silk underclothes—pink silk—and
a real evening dress, cut low, that should reveal her
shoulders and the full contour of her bust, and perhaps he
would give her enough money for a string of imitation
pearl beads as well.</p>

<p>“After all, he can afford to be generous,” Elsie thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
complacently. “An old man like him! I expect I’m a
fool to look at him, really.”</p>

<p>She meant that her attraction for men was sufficiently
potent to ensure her ability to cast her spell wherever she
chose, but common sense reminded her that the number of
men within her immediate sphere was limited. Even men
who followed her, or addressed her casually in the street,
were mostly of the bank-clerk type, and of her own actual
acquaintance scarcely one reached the level of the professional
class to which Williams belonged.</p>

<p>At Hillbourne Terrace, Elsie found the front door locked,
and realised that it must be late. She understood what
had happened. Mrs. Palmer, angry at her daughter’s
tardiness, had probably decided to give her a fright, and
was waiting in her dressing-gown, angry and tired, for
Elsie to try the side door.</p>

<p>“I just won’t, then,” muttered Elsie angrily. “I’ll
jolly well go to Ireen.”</p>

<p>She had seen a light in the house opposite as she came
up the street, and it would not be the first time that she
had called on Irene Tidmarsh for hospitality.</p>

<p>Her friend opened the door in person, and Elsie explained
her position, giving, however, no specific reason for her
lateness.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Irene indifferently. “You can sleep with
me if you want to. I often thank God I’ve no mother.”</p>

<p>The two girls went up to Irene’s large, untidy bedroom
in the front of the house, and began to undress, and Elsie
was unable to resist the topic of the pink silk underclothes
that obsessed her imagination.</p>

<p>“Geraldine says only tarts wear them.”</p>

<p>“What does she know about it?” Irene enquired.
“Ladies of title wear them—that Lady Dorothy Anvers,
that’s always being photographed, she goes in for black
silk nightgowns—<i>black</i>, if you please!”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have pink, a great deal. I think black’d
be hideous.”</p>

<p>“Depends on one’s skin, I suppose,” said the sallow
Irene thoughtfully. “Who wants to give you a silk
nightie, young Elsie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Elsie deliberated. She was not usually communicative
about her own affairs, but the notice of her employer had
gratified her vanity, and she very much desired to boast of
it to someone. Irene, at least, would be safe, and she sometimes
offered shrewd pieces of advice that were not the
outcome of experience, of which, by comparison with Elsie
herself, she had little, but of a natural acumen.</p>

<p>Elsie, when the gas had been turned out, and the two
girls were lying in Irene’s bed, after extracting giggling
oaths of secrecy, recounted to Irene the whole story of her
adventure with Mr. Williams. She represented herself as
still entirely undecided as to the sincerity of his assurance
that their relationship was to be purely friendly.</p>

<p>“Rats!” was Irene’s unvarnished comment. “It isn’t
very likely the old fool would have told you to get silk
nighties and things unless he meant to see them himself.
But I wouldn’t do it, Elsie. It’s too risky.”</p>

<p>“Why, who’s to find out? It isn’t as if his wife was
alive,” said Elsie, with a recollection of the household in
Mortimer Crescent.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that at all. But it’s a beastly risk for
you. He’s your boss, after all. Suppose he gives you the
sack, once this week-end business is over? Men are like
that—they get sick of a girl directly they’ve had their fun,
and then they don’t want to be for ever reminded of it.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite as likely he’d be for ever pestering me to go
with him again,” Elsie declared, not at all desirous of
supposing that her attractions could be provocative of such
speedy satiety. “And even if he did sack me, there are
plenty of other jobs going.”</p>

<p>“You young fool! Don’t you see what I mean?
Suppose he landed you with a baby?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Elsie was startled.</p>

<p>Like a great many other girls of her class and upbringing,
although she possessed a wide and garbled knowledge of
sex, she was singularly unable to trace the links between
cause and effect. “A baby,” in this connection, was to her
nothing but an isolated catastrophe, that she had never
particularly connected with the physical relations between
a man and a girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“It couldn’t, Ireen.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Of course it could happen. A girl I
know got caught, only luckily she had some sense, and went
to one of these doctors that can stop it for you——”</p>

<p>“Can they?”</p>

<p>“Some can,” said the well-informed Irene. “But mind
you, it’s an expensive business, and a jolly dangerous one.
Why, the doctor can be had up for doing it, I believe. So
don’t you go and get yourself into any mess of that sort,
now.”</p>

<p>“I should think not,” murmured Elsie.</p>

<p>“How old did you say this fellow, this Williams,
was?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. About forty or forty-five, or something
like that. He was years older than his wife, and she wasn’t
a chicken.”</p>

<p>“And she’s dead, is she?”</p>

<p>“Of course she is. I told you all about that ages ago.”</p>

<p>“I know. Look here, Elsie, I’ve an idea. Why don’t
you marry this fellow?”</p>

<p>“Ireen Tidmarsh, are you dotty or what?”</p>

<p>“I’m giving you jolly good advice, and you’ll be a young
fool if you don’t take it. He’s rich, and you’d have a
splendid position, and after a year or two you’d probably
find yourself free to go your own way. He wouldn’t live
for ever, either.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s true. You can bet he’s on the look-out for
a second wife already—widowers of that age always are.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t think of marrying me.”</p>

<p>“Only because he can get what he wants without,” said
Irene curtly. “You show him he can’t, and set him thinking
a bit. If he’s half as keen on you as you say he is,
anyway, the idea’s bound to cross his mind.”</p>

<p>Elsie was rather bewildered, and disposed to be incredulous.
She was incapable of having formulated so practical
an idea for herself, and it held for her a sense of unreality.
“Anyhow, I couldn’t marry an old man like that. I don’t
even like him.”</p>

<p>“Whoever you marry, young Elsie, you won’t stick to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
him,” said Irene cynically. “And if you ask me, the
quicker you get a husband the better.”</p>

<p>“That’s what mother says.”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t born yesterday. Well, do as you like, of
course, but it’s the chance of a lifetime. I’m sure of that.
Just hold out for a month—tell him you couldn’t think of
going anywhere with him—and see if he doesn’t suggest
your becoming the second Mrs. Williams.”</p>

<p>“You’re mad, Ireen,” said Elsie, entirely without conviction.</p>

<p>She was in reality very much impressed both by Irene’s
worldly wisdom and by the sudden realisation it had
brought to her of the possibilities latent in Mr. Williams’
admiration.</p>

<p>She disliked having to work, and she knew that marriage
was her only escape from work. To be married very young
would be a triumph, and she thought with malicious satisfaction
of how much she would enjoy asking Aunt Gertie and
Aunt Ada to visit her in her own house.</p>

<p>“Well, good-night,” said Irene’s voice in her ear. “I’m
going to sleep. If you want to get over to your place early
in the morning, don’t wake me, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Elsie turned over, gave a fleeting thought to the memory
of the man she had met that evening, and fell asleep
almost at once.</p>

<p>The next morning, after huddling on her clothes, and
washing her face very hastily just before putting on her hat
over her unbrushed hair, Elsie crossed the street and went
home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer was on the doorstep.</p>

<p>She was very angry.</p>

<p>“How dare you stay out all night like that, you good-for-nothing
little slut? I haven’t closed my eyes for wondering
what’d happened to you. Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“At Ireen’s.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were going there?”</p>

<p>“I never thought of it, till I got here and found the door
locked.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t locked till nearly eleven o’clock, miss, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
you could have come in by the side door, as you very well
knew. And what were you doing out till eleven o’clock,
I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Elsie, beginning to cry.</p>

<p>Her mother promptly boxed her ears. “Elsie Palmer,
you’re nothing but a liar, and you’ll break your widowed
mother’s heart and bring her to disgrace before you’re
done. However you’ve managed to grow up what you are,
so particular as I’ve been with the two of you, is more than
I can understand. Tell me this directly minute, who you
were with last night?”</p>

<p>Elsie maintained a sullen silence, dodging as her mother
aimed another heavy blow at her.</p>

<p>“I declare you’ll make me lose my temper with you!”
said Mrs. Palmer violently. “Answer me this instant.”</p>

<p>“I went to the cinema.”</p>

<p>“Who took you?”</p>

<p>“That fellow in the office—that Leary boy.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t you come in last night and say where
you’d been, then? The fact is, Elsie, you’re telling me a
pack of lies, and I know it perfectly well. You can’t take
your mother in, let me tell you, whatever you may think,
I’m sure <i>I</i> don’t know what to do with you. I sometimes
think you’d better go and live with your aunties; you’d find
Aunt Gertie strict enough, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>Elsie knew this to be true, and was fiercely resolved never
to put it to the test.</p>

<p>“What you want is a thorough good whipping,” said
Mrs. Palmer, already absent-minded and preoccupied with
preparations for breakfast. “Put that kettle on, Elsie, and
be quick about it. And I give you fair warning that the
very next time I have to speak to you like this—(see if that’s
the girl at the door—it ought to be, by this time)—the very
next time, I’ll make you remember it in a way you won’t
enjoy, my lady.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer’s active display of wrath was over, and Elsie
knew that she had nothing to do but to keep out of her
mother’s way for the next few days.</p>

<p>She helped to get the breakfast ready in silence. She was
too much used to similar scenes to feel very much upset by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
this one; nevertheless it influenced her in favour of acting
upon Irene Tidmarsh’s advice.</p>

<p>She knew very well that it would not be as easy to hoodwink
Mrs. Palmer over a week-end spent out of London as
she had pretended to Mr. Williams. Elsie was still afraid
of her mother, and believed that she might quite well
carry out her threat of sending her daughter to live with the
two aunts.</p>

<p>Her chief pang was at relinquishing the thought of the
pink silk underclothes, but she endeavoured to persuade
herself that they might still be hers, when she should be on
the point of marrying Mr. Williams. After all, it would be
more satisfactory to own them on those terms than to be
obliged to put them away after two days into hiding, in
some place—and Elsie wondered ruefully what place—where
they should not be spied out by Geraldine.</p>

<p>She went to the office as usual and was a good deal disconcerted
when Fred Leary announced that “the Old Man”
had telephoned to say that he was called away on business,
and should not be back for two days.</p>

<p>Elsie, rather afraid that her own determination might
weaken, decided to write to him, sending the letter to his
home address.</p>

<p>Her unformed, back-sloping hand, covered one side of
a sheet of notepaper that she bought in the luncheon hour.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Williams</span>,</p>

<p>“One line to tell you that I have thought over
your very kind suggestion about a holiday, but do not feel
that I can say yes to same. Dear Mr. Williams, it is very
kind of you, but I cannot feel it would be <i>right</i> of me to do
as you ask, and so I must say no, hoping you will not be

<h4>VIII</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> took Elsie exactly three months to bring Mr. Williams
to the point predicted by Irene Tidmarsh.</p>

<p>During that time she was quiet, and rather timid,
scrupulously exact in saying “sir” and very careful never
to be heard laughing or chattering with Fred Leary.</p>

<p>Williams at first made no allusion to her note. When at
last he spoke of it, he did so very much in his ordinary
manner.</p>

<p>“I was sorry to get your little note the other day, Elsie,
and to see that you don’t quite trust me after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I do,” she stammered.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “I’m afraid not. I’m afraid my
little friend isn’t quite as staunch as I fancied. It doesn’t
matter. Perhaps some day you’ll know me better.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t anything like that. It was just that I—I
thought mother wouldn’t like it,” simpered Elsie. “It
didn’t seem to me to be quite right.”</p>

<p>“It would have been quite right, or I shouldn’t have
asked you to do it,” he replied firmly. “I’m a man of
great experience, Elsie, a good many years older than you
are, and you may be quite sure that I should never mislead
you. But I see I made a mistake, you are not old enough to
have the courage to be unconventional.”</p>

<p>He looked hard at her as he spoke, but Elsie’s vanity was
not of the sort to be wounded at the term of which he had
made use. She merely drooped her head and looked
submissive.</p>

<p>A month later he asked her, in thinly veiled terms,
whether she had yet changed her mind.</p>

<p>“I shan’t ever change it,” Elsie declared. “I daresay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
I’ve sometimes been rather silly, and not as careful as I
ought, but I know very well that it wouldn’t <i>do</i> for me to
act the way you suggest. Why, you’d never respect me the
same way again, if I did!”</p>

<p>She felt that the last sentence was a masterpiece.
Williams shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Come, Elsie, let’s understand one another. You’re
not ignorant, a girl like you must have had half a dozen
men after her. And then what about that doctor fellow—Woolley?”</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m asking you. Something happened
to cause the unpleasantness between Mrs. Woolley and
yourself, and I’ve a very shrewd suspicion that I know what
it was.”</p>

<p>“Then I needn’t tell you,” said Elsie feebly.</p>

<p>“That isn’t the way to speak.”</p>

<p>His low voice was suddenly nasty, and she felt frightened.
“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t do it again, Elsie. How far did Woolley
go? That’s what I want to know.”</p>

<p>“He—he frightened me. He tried to kiss me.”</p>

<p>“And succeeded. Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Mr. <i>Williams</i>!”</p>

<p>He gazed at her stonily. “Well,” he said at last,
“I’m half inclined to believe you. How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen.”</p>

<p>“Seventeen!” he repeated after her, and his accent was
covetous. “You should be very innocent, at seventeen,
Elsie—very innocent and very pure. Now, my dear little
late wife, when we were married, although she was a
good deal older than you are, knew nothing whatever.
Her husband had to teach her everything. That’s as it
should be, Elsie.”</p>

<p>A certain prurient relish of his own topic, in Williams’
manner, affected Elsie disagreeably. Neither did she like
his reference to Mrs. Williams.</p>

<p>She was glad that the conversation should at that point
be interrupted by the entrance of the austere Mr. Cleaver.</p>

<p>Suspense was beginning to make her feel very irritable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
She now wanted Williams to propose marriage to her, but
had begun to doubt his ever doing so. He continued to
look at her meaningly, and to lay his rather desiccated
hand from time to time on her shoulder, or upon the thin
fabric of her sleeve, with a lingering, caressing touch.
Elsie, however, had inspired too many men to such demonstrations
to feel elated by them, and her employer’s proximity
roused in her little or no physical response.</p>

<p>One day, to her surprise, he brought her a present.</p>

<p>“Open it, Elsie.”</p>

<p>She eagerly lifted the lid of the small cardboard box.</p>

<p>Inside was a large turquoise brooch, shaped like a swallow,
with outspread wings.</p>

<p>She knew instantly that it had belonged to his dead wife,
but the knowledge did not lessen her pleasure at possessing
a trinket that she thought beautiful as well as valuable,
nor her triumph that he should wish to give it to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, how lovely! Do you really mean me to
keep it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, really,” Mr. Williams assured her solemnly.</p>

<p>“But I couldn’t! It’s too lovely—I mean to say, really
it is!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t, Elsie. You must please put it on, and let
me have the pleasure of seeing you wear it.”</p>

<p>“Put it on for me, then,” murmured Elsie, glancing up
at him, and then down again.</p>

<p>He took the ornament from her with hands that fumbled.
“Where?”</p>

<p>“Just <i>here</i>.”</p>

<p>She indicated the round neck of her transparent blouse,
just below the collar-bone.</p>

<p>He stuck the pin in clumsily enough, and she stifled a
little scream as it pricked her, but remained passive under
his slowly-moving, dry-skinned fingers.</p>

<p>“There! I’m sorry there isn’t a looking-glass, Elsie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got one! Don’t look, though!”</p>

<p>She stooped, pulled up her skirt, revealing a plump calf,
and in a flash had pulled out a tiny combined mirror and
powder-puff from the top of her stocking. She had no
other pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Williams did not utter a sound. He only kept his pale
grey eyes fixed gleamingly upon her.</p>

<p>“Are you shocked?” Elsie giggled. “I didn’t ought
to, I suppose, but really it’s hard to know what else to do.”</p>

<p>She peeped into the tiny looking-glass. “Isn’t it pretty!”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> are,” said Williams awkwardly. “How are you
going to thank me, Elsie?”</p>

<p>He always seemed to take pleasure in repeating her
name.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“You know what I’d like.”</p>

<p>He came nearer to her, and put his hands upon her
shoulders. Although Elsie was short, he was very little
taller.</p>

<p>She shut her eyes and put her head back, her exposed
throat throbbing visibly. She could feel his breath upon
her face, when suddenly she ducked her head, twisting out
of his grasp, and cried wildly:</p>

<p>“No, no! It isn’t right—I oughtn’t to let you! Oh,
Mr. Williams, I’d rather not have the brooch, though it’s
lovely. But I can’t be a bad girl!”</p>

<p>He had taken a step backwards in his disconcerted
amazement. “What on earth——Why, Elsie, you don’t
think there’s any harm in a kiss, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she muttered, half crying. “But you
make me feel so—so helpless, somehow, Mr. Williams.”</p>

<p>Purest instinct was guiding her, but no subtlety of
insight could have better gauged the effect of her implication
upon the little solicitor’s vanity.</p>

<p>He drew himself up, and expanded the narrow width of
his chest. “You’re not frightened of me, little girl, are
you?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” faltered Elsie.</p>

<p>“I can assure you that you needn’t be. Why, I—I—I’m
very fond of you, surely you know that?”</p>

<p>Elsie felt rather scornful of the lameness of his speech.
She saw that he was afraid of his own impulses, and the
knowledge encouraged her.</p>

<p>“Here, Mr. Williams,” she said rather tremulously,
holding out the turquoise brooch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>He closed her hand over it. “Keep it. Are you fond
of jewellery?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very.”</p>

<p>“It’s natural, at your age. I’d like to give you pretty
things, Elsie, but you mustn’t be such a little prude.”</p>

<p>“Mother always told me that one shouldn’t take a
present—not a valuable present—from a man, without he
was a relation or—or else——” She stopped.</p>

<p>“Or else what?”</p>

<p>“He’d asked one to marry him,” half whispered Elsie.</p>

<p>Williams recoiled so unmistakably that for a sickening
instant she was afraid of having gone too far.</p>

<p>Genuine tears ran down her face, and she did not know
what to say.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” said the solicitor dryly. “I’d like you to
keep the brooch, and you can thank me in your own time,
and your own way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you are!”</p>

<p>She was relieved that he said no more to her that day.</p>

<p>She wore the brooch on the following morning, and
fingered it very often. Williams eyed her complacently.</p>

<p>She began to notice that he was taking some pains with
his own appearance, occasionally wearing a flower in his
coat, and discarding the crêpe band round his arm.
She even suspected, from a certain smell noticeable in the
small office, that he was trying the effect of a hair-dye upon
his scanty strands of hair. Elsie mocked him inwardly, but
felt excited and hopeful.</p>

<p>When Williams actually did ask her to marry him, Elsie’s
head reeled with the sudden knowledge of having achieved
her end. He had offered to take her for a walk one Sunday
afternoon, and they were primly going across the Green
Park.</p>

<p>To Elsie’s secret astonishment, he had neither put his
arm round her waist nor attempted to direct their steps
towards a seat beneath one of the more distant trees. He
simply walked beside her, with short little steps, every now
and then jerking up his chin to pull at his tie, and saying
very little.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, it came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“Elsie, perhaps you don’t know that I’ve been thinking
a great deal about you lately.” He cleared his throat.
“I—I’ve been glad to see that you’re a very good girl.
Perhaps you’ve not noticed one or two little tests, as I may
call them, that I’ve put you through. We lawyers learn
to be very cautious in dealing with human nature, you know.
And I’m free to admit that I thought very highly of you
after—after thinking it over—for the attitude you took
up over that little trip we were going to take together. Not,
mind you, that you weren’t mistaken. I should never,
never have asked you to do anything that wasn’t perfectly
right and good. But your scruples, however unfounded,
made a very favourable impression on me.”</p>

<p>He stopped and cleared his throat again.</p>

<p>Intuition warned Elsie to say nothing.</p>

<p>“A young girl can’t be too particular, Elsie. But I
don’t want to give up our plan—I want my little companion
on holidays, as well as on work days. Elsie,” said
Mr. Williams impressively, “I want you to become my
little wife.”</p>

<p>And as she remained speechless, taken aback in spite of
all her previous machinations, he repeated:</p>

<p>“My dear, loving little wife.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Williams!”</p>

<p>“Call me Horace.”</p>

<p>Elsie very nearly giggled. She felt sure that it would be
quite impossible ever to call Mr. Williams Horace.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down,” she suggested feebly.</p>

<p>They found two little iron chairs, and Mr. Williams
selected them regardless of their proximity to the public
path.</p>

<p>When they sat down, Elsie, really giddy, leant back, but
Mr. Williams bent forward, not looking at her, and poking
his stick, which was between his knees, into the grass at
their feet.</p>

<p>“Of course, there is a certain difference in our ages,”
he said, speaking very carefully, “but I do not consider
that that would offer any very insuperable objection to a—a
happy married life. And I shall do my utmost to make
you happy, Elsie. My house is sadly in want of a mistress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and I shall look to you to make it bright again. You will
have a servant, of course, and I will make you an allowance
for the housekeeping, and, of course, I need hardly say that
my dear little wife will look to me for everything that
concerns her own expenditure.”</p>

<p>He glanced at her as though expecting her to be dazzled,
as indeed she was.</p>

<p>It occurred to neither of them that Elsie’s acceptance of
his proposal was being tacitly taken for granted without a
word from herself. She wondered if he would mention
Mrs. Williams, but he did not do so.</p>

<p>He continued to talk to her of his house, and of the
expensive furniture that she would find in it, and of the
fact that she would no longer have to work.</p>

<p>All these considerations appealed to Elsie herself very
strongly, and she listened to him willingly, although a
sense of derision pervaded her mind at the extraordinary
aloofness that her future husband was displaying.</p>

<p>At last, however, he signed to a taxi as they were leaving
the park, and said that he would take her to have some tea.
Almost automatically, Elsie settled herself against him as
soon as the taxi had begun to move.</p>

<p>Rather stiffly, Williams passed his arm round her. His
first kiss was a self-conscious, almost furtive affair that
Elsie received on her upraised chin.</p>

<p>Intensely irritated by his clumsiness, she threw herself
on him with sudden violence, and forced her mouth against
his in a long, clinging pressure.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Elsie Palmer was married to Horace Williams at a
registrar’s office rather less than a fortnight later.</p>

<p>Williams had insisted both upon the early date and the
quietness of the wedding. He had refused to allow Elsie
to tell her mother of the marriage until it was accomplished,
and a lurking fear of him, and schoolgirl satisfaction in
taking such a step upon her own responsibility, combined
to make her obedient.</p>

<p>Irene Tidmarsh and a man whose name Elsie never learnt,
but who came with Mr. Williams, were witnesses to the
marriage. Elsie was principally conscious that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
looking plain, unaccountably pale under a new cream-coloured
hat and feather, and with her new shoes hurting
her feet. It also occurred to her that she would have
preferred a wedding in church, with wedding-cake and a
party to follow it.</p>

<p>She felt inclined to cry, especially when they came out of
the dingy office, after an astonishingly short time spent
inside it, and found that it was raining.</p>

<p>“Where are we going to?” said Irene blankly. (“My
goodness, Elsie, just look at your ring! Doesn’t it look
queer?) I suppose you’ll take a taxi?”</p>

<p>Mr. Williams showed no alacrity to fall in with the suggestion,
but after a dubious look round at the grey sky and
rain-glistening pavement he signed with his umbrella to
a taxi-cab.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’d better. Can I see you to your ’bus
first, or do you prefer the Tube?” he added to Irene.</p>

<p>Both girls flushed, and looked at one another.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to give us lunch, I should like to
know?” murmured Elsie.</p>

<p>“I’m sure if I’m in the way, I’ll take myself off at once,
and only too pleased to do it,” said Irene, her voice very
angry. “Please don’t trouble to see me to the station,
Mr. Williams.”</p>

<p>“As you like,” he replied coolly, and held out his hand.
“Good-bye, Miss—er—Tidmarsh. I’m glad to have met
you, and I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you
in Elsie’s new home one of these days.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, do come, Ireen!” cried the bride, forgetting
her mortification for a moment. “I’ll run in and see you
one of these evenings, and we’ll settle it.”</p>

<p>“Get in, Elsie. You’re getting wet,” said Mr. Williams, and
he pushed her into the taxi and climbed in after her, leaving
Irene Tidmarsh walking away very quickly in the rain.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say you might have been a bit more civil,”
began Elsie, and then, as she turned her head round to
face him, the words died away on her lips.</p>

<p>“You didn’t think I was going to have a strange girl
here, the first minute alone with <i>my wife</i>, did you?” he
said thickly. “You little fool!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>He caught hold of her roughly and kissed her with a
vehemence that startled her. For the first time, Elsie
realised something of the possessive rights that marriage
with a man of Williams’ type would mean. For a frantic
instant she was held in the grip of that sense of irrevocability
that even the least imaginative can never wholly
escape.</p>

<p>Her panic only endured for a moment.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she began, as she felt that his embrace had
pushed her over-large hat unbecomingly to one side. She
was entirely unwarmed by passion, unattracted as she was
by the man she had married, and chilled and depressed
besides in the raw atmosphere of a pouring wet day in
London.</p>

<p>The first sound of her husband’s voice taught her her
lesson.</p>

<p>“There’s no ‘don’t’ about it now, Elsie. You remember
that, if you please. We’re man and wife now, and you’re
<i>mine</i> to do as I please with.”</p>

<p>His voice was at once bullying and gluttonous, and his
dry, grasping hands moved over her with a clutching tenacity
that reminded her sickeningly of a crab that she had
once seen in the aquarium.</p>

<p>Elsie was frightened as she had never in her life been
frightened before, and the measure of her terror was that
she could not voice it.</p>

<p>She remained absolutely silent, and as nearly as possible
motionless, beneath his unskilled caresses. Williams,
however, hardly appeared to notice her utter lack of
responsiveness. He was evidently too much absorbed in the
sudden gratification of his own hitherto suppressed desires.</p>

<p>Presently Elsie said faintly: “Where are we going to?”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d want some luncheon.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t touch a morsel,” Elsie declared, shuddering.
“Couldn’t you—couldn’t you take me home?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Hillbourne Terrace?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve got to tell mother some time to-day, and
I’d rather get it over.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Williams agreed, with a curious little smile
on his thin lips. “But you mustn’t think of it as being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
home now, you know, Elsie. Your home is where I live—where
you’re coming back with me to-night. No more
office for my little girl after to-day.”</p>

<p>His short triumphant laugh woke no echo from her.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to come in with you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do!” said Elsie indignantly. “Why,
mother’ll be simply furious! You don’t suppose I’m going
to stand up to her all by myself, do you?”</p>

<p>“Why should she be furious, Elsie? You’ve not done
anything disgraceful in marrying me.”</p>

<p>His voice was as quiet as ever, but his intonation told
her that he was offended.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that,” she explained confusedly. “Of
course, mother knows you, and all—it’s only the idea of
me having gone and been and done it all on my own hook;
that’ll upset her for a bit. She’s always wanted to make
babies of us, me and Geraldine.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told your sister anything, have you?”</p>

<p>“No fear. She’s a jealous thing, ever so spiteful, is
Geraldine. You’ll see, she’ll be as nasty as anything when
she knows I’m actually—actually——”</p>

<p>Elsie stopped, giggling.</p>

<p>“Actually what?”</p>

<p>“You know very well.”</p>

<p>“Say it.”</p>

<p>“Actually married, then,” said Elsie, blushing a good
deal and with affected reluctance.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Hillbourne Terrace, and the taxi
drew up before the familiar flight of steps, she began to feel
very nervous. She told herself that she was a married
woman, and looked at her new wedding-ring, but she did
not feel in the least like a married woman, nor independent
of Mrs. Palmer’s anger.</p>

<p>Elsie’s mother opened the door herself. “What on
earth——Are you ill, Elsie, coming home in a cab at this
hour of the morning? Whatever next!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Williams is here, Mother,” said Elsie, pushing her
way into the dining-room.</p>

<p>Geraldine was there, a check apron, torn and greasy, tied
round her waist, and her hair still in curling-pins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>She was placing clean forks and spoons all round the table.</p>

<p>She looked at her sister with unfriendly surprise. Elsie
had worn her everyday clothes on leaving home that
morning, and had changed at Irene’s house.</p>

<p>“Whatever are you dressed up like that for?” said
Geraldine at once.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to know?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know where you get the money to pay for
your new hats,” said Geraldine significantly. “First one
thing, and then another—I wonder you don’t sport a tiara,
young Elsie.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may, before I’ve done.”</p>

<p>Elsie was not really thinking of what she was saying, but
was rather listening to a sound of voices in the hall outside
that denoted a conversation between Williams and Mrs.
Palmer.</p>

<p>She could not help hoping that he was breaking the news
of their marriage to her mother. Elsie still felt certain
that Mrs. Palmer would be very angry. It astonished her
when her mother came into the room and kissed her
vehemently.</p>

<p>“You sly young monkey, you! Geraldine, has this
girl told you what she’s done?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Gone and got married! This morning!! To Mr.
Horace Williams!!!” Mrs. Palmer’s voice rose in a
positively jubilant crescendo.</p>

<p>“<i>Married!</i>” screamed Geraldine. Her face became
scarlet, and then grey.</p>

<p>“My little girl, married at seventeen!” said Mrs.
Palmer with her head on one side.</p>

<p>She examined Elsie’s plump hand with its wedding-ring.</p>

<p>Horace Williams stood by, quietly smiling. “Then
you’re willing to trust her to me, Mrs. Palmer? You’ll
forgive us for taking you by surprise, but you see, in all
the circumstances, I could hardly—I naturally preferred—something
very quiet. But you and I will have a little
talk about business one of these days, and you’ll find that
part of it all in good order. Elsie will be provided for,
whatever happens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“So generous,” murmured Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>She insisted upon their remaining to dinner, and sent
out Nellie Simmons for a bottle of wine. Elsie, now that
she saw that her mother looked upon her marriage with the
elderly solicitor as a triumph, and that Geraldine was madly
jealous of her, became herself excited and elated.</p>

<p>Williams went to the office in the afternoon, but Elsie
remained at home and packed up all her things.</p>

<p>She made her farewells quite cheerfully when Williams
came to fetch her, still thinking of her mother’s repeated
congratulations and praises.</p>

<p>It came upon her as a shock, as they were driving away,
when Williams observed dryly:</p>

<p>“That’s over, and now there’ll be no need for you to be
over here very often, Elsie, or <i>vice versa</i>. You must
remember that <i>my</i> house is your only home, now.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">PART II</h3>

<h4>I</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> European war affected Elsie Williams as much, or as
little, as it affected many other young women. She had
been married a little over a year in August 1914.</p>

<p>She was vaguely alarmed, vaguely thrilled, moved to a
great display of emotional enthusiasm at the sight of a
khaki uniform and at the sound of a military band.</p>

<p>Later on, she sang and hummed “Keep the Home Fires
Burning,” “Tipperary,” and “We <i>Don’t</i> Want to Lose You,
but we Think you <i>Ought</i> to Go,” and was voluble and
indignant about the difficulties presented by sugar rations
and meat coupons. She resented the air raids over London,
and devoured the newspaper accounts of the damage done
by them; she listened to, and eagerly retailed, anecdotes
such as that of the Angels of Mons, or that of the Belgian
child whose hands had been cut off by German soldiers;
and after a period in which she declared that “everybody”
would be ruined, she found herself in possession of more
money than ever before.</p>

<p>Never before had so many clients presented themselves
to Messrs. Williams and Cleaver, and never before had there
been so much money about. Elsie bought herself a fur
coat and a great many other things, and went very often
to the cinema, and sometimes to the theatre. She very
soon found, however, that Williams, when he could not take
her out himself, disliked her going with anybody else.</p>

<p>He was willing enough that she should take Irene with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
her, or her sister Geraldine, but if she went out with any
man, Williams became coldly, caustically angry, and sooner
or later always found an opportunity for quarrelling with
him.</p>

<p>Elsie was bored and angry, contemptuous of his jealousy,
but far too much afraid of him to rebel openly.</p>

<p>She was more and more conscious of having made a
mistake in her marriage, but her regrets were resentful
rather than profound, and her facile nature found consolation
in her own social advancement, her comfortable
suburban home, and her tyrannical dominion over a capped
and aproned maid.</p>

<p>She very seldom went to Hillbourne Terrace, and had
quarrelled with her mother when Mrs. Palmer had suggested
that it was time she had a baby.</p>

<p>Elsie did not want to have a baby at all. She feared
pain and discomfort almost as much as she did the temporary
eclipse of her good looks, and the thought of a child that
should be Horace Williams’s as well as hers filled her with
disgust.</p>

<p>She only spoke of this openly to Irene, and Irene undertook
the purchase of certain drugs which she declared would
render impossible the calamity dreaded by her friend. Elsie
thankfully accepted the offer, and trusted implicitly to the
efficacy of the bottles and packages that Irene bought.</p>

<p>Sometimes Horace declared that he wanted a son, and as
time went on his taunts became less veiled, but Elsie cared
little for them so long as she remained immune from the
trial of motherhood.</p>

<p>She spent her days idly, doing very little housework,
sometimes making or mending her own clothes, and often
poring for a whole afternoon over a novel from the circulating
library, or an illustrated paper, whilst she ate innumerable
sweets out of little paper bags. She never remembered
anything about the books that she read thus, and
sometimes read the same one a second time without perceiving
that she was doing so until she had nearly finished it.</p>

<p>After a time, Elsie became rather envious of the money
that Irene was making as a munitions worker, and the
“good time” that Geraldine enjoyed in the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
office where she had found a job. Elsie seriously told her
husband that she felt she must go and do some “war
work.”</p>

<p>“You are not in the same position as an unmarried
girl, Elsie. You have other duties. These war jobs are
for young women who have nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that I’ve got so much to do.”</p>

<p>“If you had children, you would understand that a
woman’s sphere is in her own home.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got children,” said Elsie, half under her
breath.</p>

<p>“It’s early days to talk like that,” Williams retorted, and
his glance at her was malevolent. “One of these days you’ll
have a baby, I hope, like every other healthy married
woman, and neither you nor I nor anybody else can say
how soon that day may come.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose till it does come—<i>if</i> it ever does-you’ve
no objection to me doing my bit in regard to this
war?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What is it you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, get a job of some kind. Ireen says they’re asking
for shorthand-typists all over the place, and willing to pay
for them, too. I could get into one of these Government
shows easily, or I could go in the V.A.D.s or something,
and take a job in a hospital.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Williams decidedly. “No. Out of the
question.”</p>

<p>Elsie, who at home had, as a matter of course, surreptitiously
disobeyed every order or prohibition of her mother’s
that ran counter to her own wishes, knew already that she
would not disobey her husband.</p>

<p>She was afraid of him.</p>

<p>On the rare occasions when she saw any of her own
family, Elsie always made a great display of her own
grandeur and independence. She was really proud of her
little suburban villa, her white-and-gold china, fumed oak
“suite” of drawing-room furniture, “ruby” glasses and
plated cake basket. She was also proud of being Mrs.
Williams, and of wearing a wedding-ring.</p>

<p>Geraldine came to see her once or twice, and then declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
herself too busy at the office to take the long tram journey,
and as Elsie hardly ever went to Hillbourne Terrace, they
seldom met. But Irene Tidmarsh came often to see Elsie.</p>

<p>She came in the daytime, when Williams was at the office,
and very often she and Elsie went to the cinema together
in the afternoon. Irene seemed able to get free time whenever
she liked, and she explained this to Elsie by telling
her that the superintendent at the works was a great friend
of hers.</p>

<p>Elsie perfectly understood what this meant, and realised
presently that Irene was never available on Saturdays and
Sundays.</p>

<p>The war went on, and Mr. Williams made more and more
money, and was fairly generous to Elsie, although he never
gave her an independent income, but only occasional
presents of cash, and instructions that all her bills should be
sent in to him.</p>

<p>He did not rescind his command that she should not
attempt any war work, although, as the months lengthened
into years, it seemed fairly certain that there was to be no
family to give Elsie occupation at home.</p>

<p>At twenty-five, Elsie Williams, from sheer boredom, had
lost a great deal of the vitality that had characterised
Elsie Palmer, and with it a certain amount of her remarkable
animal magnetism. She was still attractive to men, but
her own susceptibilities had become strangely blunted and
no casual promiscuity would now have power to stir her.</p>

<p>She was aware that life had become uninteresting to her,
and accepted the fact with dull, bewildered, entirely
unanalytical resentment.</p>

<p>“I s’pose I’m growing middle-aged,” she said to Irene,
giggling without conviction.</p>

<p>One day, more than a year after the Armistice in November
1918, Irene Tidmarsh came to Elsie full of excitement.</p>

<p>She had heard of a wonderful crystal-gazer, and wanted
to visit her with Elsie.</p>

<p>Elsie was quite as much excited as Irene. “I’d better
take off my wedding-ring,” she said importantly. “They
say they’ll get hold of any clue, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“This woman isn’t like that,” Irene declared. “She’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
what they call a psychic, really she is. This girl that told
me about her, she said it quite frightened her, the things the
woman knew. All sorts of things about her past, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I’d like that,” said Elsie, giggling. “I
know quite enough about my past without wanting help.
But I must say I’d like to know what she’s got to say about
the future. You know, I mean what’s going to happen to
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’re married, my dear. There’s not much
else she can tell you, except whether you’ll have boys or
girls.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” Elsie exclaimed, tossing her head.
“None of that truck for me, thank you. Losing one’s
figure and all!”</p>

<p>“You’re right. Anyway, let’s come on, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Come on. I say, Ireen, she’ll see us both together,
won’t she?”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I wouldn’t go in to her alone for anything.
Swear you won’t ever repeat anything she says about me,
though.”</p>

<p>“I swear. And you won’t either?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The crystal-gazer lived in a street off King’s Road,
Chelsea, a long way down.</p>

<p>A little hunch-backed girl opened the door and asked
them to go into the waiting-room. This was a small,
curtained recess off the tiny hall, and contained two chairs
and a rickety table covered with thin, cheap-looking
publications. There were several copies of a psychic paper
and various pamphlets that purported to deal with the
occult.</p>

<p>“I’m a bit nervous, aren’t you?” whispered Elsie.
She fiddled with her wedding-ring, and finally took it off
and put it in her purse. When the hunch-backed child
appeared at the curtains, both girls screamed slightly.</p>

<p>“Madame Clara is ready for you,” announced the little
girl, in a harsh, monotonous voice.</p>

<p>She led them up to the first floor, into a room that was
carefully darkened with blue curtains drawn across the
windows. They could just discern a black figure, stout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and very upright, sitting on a large chair in the middle of
the room. A round stand set on a single slender leg was
beside her.</p>

<p>Elsie clutched at Irene’s hand in a nervous spasm.</p>

<p>The black figure bowed from the waist without rising.
“Do you wish me to see you both together, ladies?”
Her voice was harsh and rather raucous in tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, please,” said Irene boldly.</p>

<p>“You quite understand that the charge will be the same
as for two separate interviews?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The little girl advanced with a small beaded bag. “The
fee is payable in advance, if you please.”</p>

<p>Elsie fumbled in her purse, and pulled out two ten-shilling
notes.</p>

<p>“Half a guinea each, if you please, ladies.”</p>

<p>“Irene, have you got two sixpences?” Elsie whispered,
agitated.</p>

<p>Irene, by far the more collected of the two, produced a
shilling, and the little girl with the bag went away.</p>

<p>“Will you two ladies be seated? One on either side of
the table, please—not next to one another.”</p>

<p>Elsie made a despairing clutch at Irene’s hand again,
but her friend shook her head, and firmly took her place on
the other side of Madame Clara.</p>

<p>Elsie sank into the remaining chair, and felt that she was
trembling violently. Her nervousness was partly pleasurable
excitement, and partly involuntary reaction to the
atmosphere diffused by the dim, shaded room and the autocratic
solemnity of Madame Clara.</p>

<p>A sweet, rather sickly smell was discernible.</p>

<p>The silence affected Elsie so that she wanted to scream.</p>

<p>Her eyes were by this time accustomed to the semi-darkness,
and she could see that Madame Clara was leaning
forward, her loose sleeves falling away from her fat, bare
arms, her elbows resting on the little table, and her hands
over her eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the woman drew herself upright, and turned
towards Irene.</p>

<p>“You, first. You have a stronger personality than your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
friend. It was you who brought her here. Do you wish
me to look into the crystal for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” gasped Irene.</p>

<p>Elsie wondered from where the crystal would appear,
and then she noticed the faint outline of a globe in front of
the seer, on the little stand.</p>

<p>A thrill of superstitious awe ran through her.</p>

<p>“Make your mind a blank as far as possible, please ...
do not think of the past, the present, or the future ...
relax ... relax ... relax....”</p>

<p>Madame Clara’s voice deepened, and she began to speak
very slowly and distinctly, leaning back in her chair, the
crystal ball before her eyes.</p>

<p>“Time is an arbitrary division made by man—the crystal
will not always show what is past and what is to come.
For instance, I see illness here—bodily suffering—but I
do not know if it has visited you or is still to come. It
may even be the suffering of one near to you....”</p>

<p>She paused for an instant, and Elsie just caught Irene’s
smothered exclamation of “Father!”</p>

<p>“Hush, please,” said the seeress. “The shadow of sickness
deepens—it deepens into the blackness of death. A
man—an old man—he is dying. You will get money from
him. Beware of those who seek to flatter you. You are
impressionable, but clear-sighted; impulsive, yet self-controlled;
reserved, but intensely passionate. I see
marriage for you in the future, but with a man somewhat
older than yourself. I see conflict....” She stopped again.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the conflict is already over. You have certainly
known love—passion——”</p>

<p>Elsie, from mingled nervousness and embarrassment,
suddenly giggled.</p>

<p>The clairvoyante raised an authoritative hand. “It is
impossible for me to go on if there are resistances,” she
said angrily, in the voice that she had used at first, ugly and
rather hoarse.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Elsie!” came sharply from Irene.</p>

<p>Elsie ran her finger-nails into her palms in an endeavour
to check the nervous, spasmodic laughter that threatened
to overcome her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“The current is broken,” said Madame Clara in an indignant
voice.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>At last Elsie heard Irene say timidly:</p>

<p>“Won’t you go on, madame?”</p>

<p>“I’m exhausted,” said the medium in a fatigued voice.
“You will have to return to me another day—alone. All
that I can say to you now, I have said. Beware of opals,
and of a red-haired man. Your lucky stone is the turquoise—you
should wear light blue, claret colour, and all shades of
yellow, and avoid pinks, reds and purple.”</p>

<p>She stopped.</p>

<p>Elsie, though awestruck, was also vaguely disappointed.
It did not seem to her that she had learnt a great deal about
Irene, and the warnings about colours and precious stones
might have come out of any twopenny booklet off a railway
bookstall, such as “What Month Were You Born In?”
or “Character and Fortune Told by Handwriting.”</p>

<p>Then she remembered that she herself had made Madame
Clara angry by laughing, and that the woman had said the
current was broken.</p>

<p>“Probably she’s furious,” Elsie thought, “and she
won’t tell me as much as she told Ireen. And she’s got our
money, too. What a swindle!”</p>

<p>“What about my friend?” said Irene Tidmarsh. Her
voice sounded rather sulky.</p>

<p>“Your friend is a sceptic,” said the clairvoyante
coldly.</p>

<p>“No, really——” Elsie began.</p>

<p>The woman turned towards her so abruptly that she was
startled.</p>

<p>She could discern an enormous pair of heavy-looking
dark eyes gazing into hers.</p>

<p>“Make your mind a blank—relax,” said Madame Clara,
her tone once more a commanding one.</p>

<p>Elsie moved uneasily in her chair and fixed her eyes on
the crystal. She could only see it faintly, a glassy spot of
uncertain outline.</p>

<p>The seeress bent forward, leaning over the transparent
globe. After a moment or two she began to speak, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
same voice and intonation that she had made use of in
speaking about Irene.</p>

<p>“The crystal reflects all things, but Time is an arbitrary
division made by man—we do not always see what is past,
and what is future.... In your case, there is very little
past—how young you are!—and what there is, is all on one
plane, the physical. You are magnetic, extraordinarily
magnetic. You have known men—you are married, if not
by man’s law, then by nature’s law—you will know other
men. But you are not awake—your mind is asleep. Nothing
is awake but your senses....”</p>

<p>Elsie’s mouth was dry. She longed to stop the woman
but a horrible fascination kept her silent, tensely
listening.</p>

<p>“Now you are bored—satiated. You have repeated the
same experience again and again, young as you are, until
it means nothing to you. You have no outside interests—and
you are ceaselessly craving for a new emotion.”</p>

<p>Abruptly the sibyl dropped on to a dark note.</p>

<p>“It will come. I see love here—love that you have never
known yet. There will be jealousy, intrigue—letters will
pass—beware of the written word——<i>Ah!</i>”</p>

<p>The exclamation was so sudden and so piercing that
Elsie uttered a stifled scream. But this time she was not
rebuked.</p>

<p>Madame Clara, all at once, was calling out shrilly in a
hard voice, an indescribable blend of horror and excitement
in her tone:</p>

<p>“Oh, God—what is it? Look—look, there in the crystal—what
have you done? There’s blood, and worse than
blood! Oh, my God, what’s this? It’s all over England—<i>you</i>—they’re
talking about <i>you</i>——”</p>

<p>Irene Tidmarsh screamed wildly, and Elsie realised that
she had sprung to her feet. She herself was utterly unable
to move, wave after wave of sick terror surging through
her as the high, unrecognisable voice of the clairvoyante
screeched and ranted, and then broke horribly.</p>

<p>“It’s blood! My God, get out of here! I won’t see any
more—you’re all over blood!...”</p>

<p>A strange, strangled cry, that Elsie did not recognise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
as having come from her own lips, broke across the obscurity,
the room surged round her, she tried to clutch at
the table, and felt herself falling heavily.</p>

<p>Elsie Williams had fainted.</p>

<p>She came back to a dazed memory of physical nausea,
bewilderment, and resentment, as she felt herself being
unskilfully pulled into a sitting position.</p>

<p>“Let go,” she muttered, “let me go....”</p>

<p>“She’s coming round! For Heaven’s sake, Elsie ...
here, try and get hold of her....”</p>

<p>She felt herself pulled and propelled to her feet, and even
dragged a few steps by inadequate supporters.</p>

<p>Then she sank down again, invaded by a renewal of
deadly sickness, but she was conscious that they had somehow
got her outside the dark, scented room, and that the
door had been slammed behind her.</p>

<p>Very slowly her perceptions cleared, and she realised that
Irene was gripping her on one side, and the little hunch-backed
girl holding a futile hand beneath her elbow on the
other.</p>

<p>With an effort, Elsie raised her head.</p>

<p>“Look here, old girl, are you better?” said Irene, low
and urgently. “I want to get out of here as quickly as
possible. D’you think you can get downstairs?”</p>

<p>Elsie, without clearly knowing why, was conscious that
she, too, wanted to get away.</p>

<p>She pulled herself to her feet, shuddering, and staggered
down the stairs, leaning heavily on Irene.</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you just turned queer. Don’t think about it.
Look here, we’d better have a taxi, hadn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I couldn’t walk a step, that’s certain. Why,
my knees are shaking under me.”</p>

<p>“Go and get a taxi,” Irene commanded the hunch-backed
child, who went obediently away.</p>

<p>Elsie sat down on the lowest stair and wiped her wet,
cold face with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“What made me go off like that, Ireen? That woman
said something beastly, didn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Oh she’s mad, that’s what she is. She suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
started ranting, and you got frightened, I suppose—and no
wonder. Never mind, you’ll soon be home now.”</p>

<p>It struck Elsie that Irene was looking at her in a strangely
anxious way, and that she was talking almost at random,
as though to obliterate the impression of what had passed
at the <i>séance</i>.</p>

<p>Elsie herself could not remember clearly, but there was
a lurking horror at the back of her mind.</p>

<p>“What did she say?” she persisted feebly.</p>

<p>“Here’s the taxi!” cried Irene, in intense relief. “Here,
get in, Elsie. Thank you,” she added to the child. “Don’t
wait, I’ll tell the man where to go.”</p>

<p>She gave the driver Elsie’s address after the little girl had
entered the house again, and then climbed in beside her
friend, drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord! We got away pretty quickly, didn’t
we? Well, it’s the last time I’ll meddle with anything of
that kind, I swear. I say, Elsie, had we better stop at a
chemist’s and get you something?”</p>

<p>“Yes—no. I don’t care. Ireen, I want to know what
that woman said. It was something awful about <i>me</i>,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“She had a—kind of fit, I think. I don’t believe she
knew what she was saying—she just screamed out a pack
of nonsense. And you gave a yell, and went down like a
log. I can tell you, you’ve pretty nearly scared the life out
of me, young Elsie.”</p>

<p>Irene was indeed oddly white-faced and jerky. Her
manner was as unnatural as was her sudden volubility.</p>

<p>Elsie, still feeling weak and giddy, leant her head back and
closed her eyes. She felt quite unable to make the effort of
remembering what had happened at the clairvoyante’s
house, and was moreover instinctively aware that the
recollection, when it did come, would bring dismay and
terror.</p>

<p>She and Irene Tidmarsh did not exchange a word until
the taxi stopped.</p>

<p>“Here we are. You’d better pay him, Elsie. I’ll
take the Tube from the corner, and get home in half an
hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Aren’t you coming in with me?” said Elsie, surprised.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I will. I’d rather get straight
home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do!” urged Elsie, half crying. She felt very much
shaken. “I’m all alone; Horace won’t be back till seven,
and this has upset me properly. Besides, I know I shall
remember what it was that awful woman said in a minute,
and I’m frightened. You <i>must</i> come in, Ireen.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” repeated Irene, inexorably. “I ... really,
I’d rather not, Elsie.”</p>

<p>The door opened, and Irene turned rapidly and walked
away down the street.</p>

<p>Elsie tottered into the house.</p>

<p>“I’m ill,” she said abruptly to the servant. “I fainted
while I was out, and I feel like nothing on earth now. I
shall go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’m. Shall I go for a doctor, ’m?” said the girl
zealously.</p>

<p>“No,” said Elsie sharply. “I don’t want a doctor.
Telephone to Mr. Williams at the office, Emma, and ask
him to come home early. Say I’m ill.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’m.”</p>

<p>Elsie dragged herself upstairs and took off some of her
clothes. She was shivering violently, and presently pulled
her blue cotton kimono round her and slipped into bed.
She lay there with closed eyes, shuddering from time to time,
until Emma brought up a cup of strong tea. Elsie drank it
avidly, lay down again and felt revived. Presently she
dozed.</p>

<p>The opening of the door roused her. It was nearly dark,
but she knew that it must be her husband, who never
knocked before entering their joint bedroom.</p>

<p>“What’s all this, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“I felt rotten,” she said wearily. “Turn on the light,
Horace.”</p>

<p>He did so, and advanced towards the bed. His face
wore an expression of concern, and he walked on tiptoe.</p>

<p>“I fainted while I was out with Ireen,” Elsie explained,
“and I was simply ages coming to. We came back in a
cab, and I must say Ireen’s awfully selfish. She wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
come in with me, though she must have seen I wasn’t fit to
be left—just turned and walked off. I’m done with her,
after this.”</p>

<p>“Where had you been?” enquired Williams quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, just out.”</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll call me a fool, if I say it was to see one
of those clairvoyante women, someone Ireen had heard
of. It was all Ireen’s doing—she persuaded me to go.”</p>

<p>“Very silly of you both,” said the little solicitor coldly.
“Did this person upset you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She had a sort of fit, I think, and called out a
whole lot of nonsense, only I can’t remember what it was.”
Elsie moved uneasily.</p>

<p>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“She ought to be prosecuted for obtaining money under
false pretences. I suppose you gave her money?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes.”</p>

<p>“You’d better give me her name and address and I’ll
see that she is properly dealt with.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not.”</p>

<p>Horace Williams shrugged his shoulders. “Well, you’d
better get up and come down to supper, hadn’t you?
There’s no reason for lying in bed if you’re not ill.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Elsie agreed sullenly.</p>

<p>Her husband never shouted at her or threatened her, but
she was afraid of him, and of a certain sinister dryness that
characterised his manner when he was displeased.</p>

<p>The dryness was there now.</p>

<p>Elsie spent the evening downstairs. Her husband read
the newspaper, and she turned over the pages of a fashion
magazine listlessly. Her thoughts, unwillingly enough,
returned again and again to the scene in the clairvoyante’s
room, but still she could not remember the actual words
screamed out by Madame Clara before she had lost consciousness.
But she remembered quite well other words,
that had preceded them.</p>

<p>“You are magnetic ... extraordinarily magnetic....
You are not awake—your mind is asleep.... Now, you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
bored, satiated. You are ceaselessly craving for a new
emotion....”</p>

<p>Elsie reflected how true this was.</p>

<p>She glanced distastefully at her elderly husband.</p>

<p>The bald patch glistened on the top of his head, and he was
breathing heavily as he read his newspaper.</p>

<p>He had always been rather distasteful to her physically,
and although the continuous, degradingly inevitable
proximity of married life in a small suburban villa had
hardened her into indifference, Elsie was still averse from
the more intimate aspects of marriage with him.</p>

<p>She wished that she could fall in love, remembering that
Madame Clara had said: “I see love here—love that you
have never known yet.”</p>

<p>“That’s bunkum,” thought Elsie. “I’ve been in love
heaps of times—I was in love with that doctor fellow,
Woolley. It doesn’t last, that’s all.”</p>

<p>She hardly ever met any men nowadays, as she resentfully
reminded herself.</p>

<p>The husbands of her married friends were at work all
day, and if she occasionally met them at their wives’
card-parties, they did not interest her very greatly.
Most of the wives distrusted the husbands and gave them
no opportunity for flirtation with other women. And
Horace Williams himself was a jealous man, always suspicious,
and never allowed his young wife to go anywhere
with any man but himself.</p>

<p>Elsie had been for a long while in inward revolt against
the dullness of her life. She remembered with longing the
old days of her girlhood, when every walk had been the
prelude to adventure, and the casual kisses of unknown, or
scarcely known, men had roused her to rapture.</p>

<p>Nowadays, she knew very well that she would be less
easily satisfied. The apathy that had been creeping over
her ever since her marriage had to a certain extent lessened
the force of the animal magnetism by which she had been
able to lure the senses of almost every man she met, and for
the first time she was beginning to have doubts of her own
attractiveness.</p>

<p>Elsie gave a sigh that was almost a groan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Williams neither stirred nor raised his eyes.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll retire to my little downy,” Elsie murmured,
drearily facetious.</p>

<p>“It’s only a quarter past nine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we lead such a deliriously exciting life that
I’d better get some rest, hadn’t I?” she said ironically.
“Just to make up for all the late nights we have.”</p>

<p>At last her husband put down the paper and looked coldly
at her through his pince-nez. “What is it you want, Elsie?
I work hard all day at the office, and you have plenty of
time and money for amusing yourself in the daytime—and
a strange use you seem to make of them, judging by to-day’s
performance. What more do you want?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We might go to the pictures sometimes,
or to a play. I hate not having anything to do.”</p>

<p>“That’s the complaint of every woman who hasn’t got
children.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said Elsie angrily.</p>

<p>He said nothing, but continued to fix his eyes upon her,
with his most disagreeable expression.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Horace.”</p>

<p>“I shall come up to bed before you’re asleep,” he said
meaningly.</p>

<p>She went out of the room.</p>

<p>The thought crossed her mind, as it had often done before,
that she had made a frightful mistake in marrying Horace
Williams.</p>

<p>“I was only eighteen,” she thought, “I ought to have
waited. Perhaps he’ll die.”</p>

<p>As she undressed, Elsie idly imagined a drama of which
she herself would, of course, be the heroine.</p>

<p>Horace would be at the office, as usual, and a telephone
message would come through to say that he was ill—very ill
indeed—he was dead. Everyone would admire the
young widow in her black, with her string of pearl
beads.... Horace would leave her quite a lot of money.
Elsie knew that he was rich, although he had never told her
his income. She would stay on in the villa, but people would
come and see her—she would go out and enjoy herself—enjoy
life, once more....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Elsie sighed again as she got into bed.</p>

<p>Bored and exhausted, she fell asleep almost at once, to
dream vividly.</p>

<p>In her dream, she stood outside a closed door, knowing
that something unspeakably horrid lay beyond it. Terror
paralysed her. At last she pushed at the door, but it would
not yield more than an inch or two. Something was behind
it. She looked down and saw a dark stain spreading round
her feet, oozing from beneath the resistant door.</p>

<p>Screaming and sweating, Elsie woke up, and as she did so
the remembrance came back to her in full of everything
that the clairvoyante had said that morning.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>

<h4>II</h4>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hallo</span>, Elsie!”</p>

<p>“Hallo, Geraldine!”</p>

<p>“You’re quite a stranger, aren’t you? I think it’s
about a year since we had the honour of seeing your majesty
last.”</p>

<p>“Well, now I have come, aren’t you going to take the
trouble to invite me to come in?” asked Elsie good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“There’s a visitor of mine in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>“Who is it? Aunt Ada?”</p>

<p>“No, not Aunt Ada, Miss Smarty. It’s a friend of mine,
I tell you, who I knew at the office during the war.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can introduce me to her, I suppose,” said
Elsie carelessly.</p>

<p>She noticed that Geraldine’s hair was not, as it generally
was, in curling-pins, and that she was wearing a new dress,
of an unbecoming shade of emerald green. Geraldine
always went wrong over her clothes, Elsie reflected complacently.
She herself wore a new black picture hat, and
it was partly from the desire to show herself in it that she
had come to her old home.</p>

<p>“Where’s mother?”</p>

<p>“Out.”</p>

<p>“What a mercy!”</p>

<p>Elsie walked into the familiar drawing-room, feeling glad
that she no longer lived at Hillbourne Terrace, under her
mother’s dominion, and forced to share a bedroom with the
fretful Geraldine.</p>

<p>A young man of two- or three-and-twenty was sitting in
the drawing-room, and rose to his feet as Elsie and Geraldine
came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“This is my sister, Mrs. Horace Williams. Elsie, this is
my friend, Mr. Morrison,” said Geraldine with pride.</p>

<p>Elsie was immediately conscious of a quickened interest.
The young man was of a type that appealed strongly to
her; dark and tall, with very brown eyes, and a wistful,
ingenuous smile that was the more noticeable because he
was clean-shaven.</p>

<p>When they shook hands, she was conscious of the slight,
unmistakable thrill of mutual magnetism.</p>

<p>“I thought I was going to find a young lady in here,
when Geraldine told me she had a friend!” Elsie exclaimed,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Sorry I’m a disappointment,” Mr. Morrison replied,
also laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t say that. Only my sister doesn’t have
gentlemen friends as a rule,” Elsie declared innocently.</p>

<p>Geraldine’s sallow face flushed. “You don’t know much
about it, do you, considering that we never see you nowadays.
I’m not one for talking much about my own affairs, either,
so far as I’m aware. It’s a misfortune, really, to be as
reserved as I am. I often wish I wasn’t!”</p>

<p>It was unprecedented, in Elsie’s experience, to hear
Geraldine setting forth a claim, however obliquely, to be
considered interesting. Elsie looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>“She must be gone on this fellow,” she thought, and
without the slightest compunction she immediately put
forth all her own powers to attract Morrison’s notice and
admiration to herself.</p>

<p>The task proved to be as easy as it was congenial. In
a very little while, Elsie and young Morrison were talking
and joking together, and it was only an occasional,
spasmodic, and quite evidently conscientious effort from
Morrison that from time to time caused Geraldine to be
included in the conversation.</p>

<p>Morrison told Elsie that he travelled for a big firm of silk
merchants in the City, and was very little in London.</p>

<p>“How did you and Geraldine meet, then? I thought
you were in the same office as her during the war,” said
Elsie sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“Just for six months I was, and then I got this job in the
place of a man who’d joined up. I was under age for
joining up myself, worse luck,” said the youth.</p>

<p>Then he must be younger than she was herself, Elsie
reflected, surprised. She felt oddly touched by the thought.</p>

<p>She looked at Morrison, and found that he was looking
at her with admiration evident in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>Elsie allowed her eyes to dwell for a second on his before
she broke the momentary silence. “What about tea,
Geraldine?”</p>

<p>“All right,” said her sister sulkily. “Where’s the
hurry?”</p>

<p>It was already half-past four, but Elsie guessed that
Geraldine did not want to go and fetch the tea and leave
her alone with Morrison.</p>

<p>“No hurry, I suppose,” she cried gaily, “but I’m a bit
tired, that’s all, and I thought I’d like a nice cup of tea.
It’s a good long way to come, and the Tube was pretty full.”</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” Morrison asked eagerly.</p>

<p>She named the suburb. “You must come and look us
up one day, Mr. Morrison. My husband is a solicitor, and
he’s always at home on Saturdays and Sundays. The
rest of the week I’m by myself and ever so lonely,” sighed
Elsie.</p>

<p>“I’d love to come. I should—er—like to meet Mr.
Williams,” said Morrison solemnly.</p>

<p>“Here’s Mother!” Geraldine announced sharply, as a
door banged downstairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer came in, breathing heavily, her hands full of
parcels.</p>

<p>“Elsie! Dear me, this <i>is</i> a surprise. Good afternoon, Mr.
Morrison, how are you? Quite well, thank you, but for
Anno Domini, that’s all that’s the matter with me.” She
dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>“Where’s tea?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it up,” said Geraldine.</p>

<p>“Go and give her a hand,” Mrs. Palmer calmly directed
young Morrison. “My gurl is out. They’re all the same,
nowadays—always out, never in.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> never have any trouble with servants,” Elsie murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>She was annoyed that her mother should thus dismiss
Morrison, and that he should meekly prepare to obey her.</p>

<p>He opened the door for Geraldine and went out behind her,
and Elsie heard her sister talking animatedly as they went
downstairs.</p>

<p>“What’s come over Geraldine?” she coldly enquired.</p>

<p>“Why should anything have come over her, as you call
it? Geraldine’s a gurl like you are, I’d have you remember,
and a very much better one than you’ve ever been, to her
widowed mother. You mind your own business, Elsie.”</p>

<p>“That’s a nice way to speak to me, when I haven’t been
at home for I don’t know how long.”</p>

<p>“And whose fault has that been?” enquired Mrs. Palmer.
“Not but what I’m always pleased to see you, Elsie, as
I’ve told you time and time again, and Mr. Williams too—Horace,
I should say—if he cares to come. But don’t you
go interfering with Geraldine’s friends.”</p>

<p>“Is this fellow a friend of hers?”</p>

<p>“Of course he is. They’ve been going together for some
time now.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she’s not engaged?”</p>

<p>“No, she’s not engaged,” Mrs. Palmer reluctantly conceded.
“But I’m free to confess that I hope she will be.
This Leslie Morrison is a nice fellow, as steady as can be.”</p>

<p>Elsie reflected that Leslie was a lovely name.</p>

<p>“Now, Elsie,” said her mother warningly, “I know what
you are, and I give you fair notice that I won’t have any of
your goings-on. You’ll remember that you’re a married
woman, if you please, and just behave yourself. Any of
your old tricks, my lady, and I shall drop the hint to Horace.
Him and me knew one another before ever he set eyes on
you.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason for not making mischief between us
now. He’s jealous enough as it is, making a fuss of anyone
so much as looks the same side of the room as I happen
to be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame him,” said Mrs. Palmer curtly. “You’re
a caution, you are, and always have been. I don’t mind
telling you that I never was more thankful in my life than
to get you safely married. And don’t you go casting sheep’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
eyes at poor Geraldine’s fellow, for I tell you I won’t have
it.”</p>

<p>Elsie laughed scornfully. She was secretly flattered at
the alarm that was conveyed by Mrs. Palmer’s reiterated
cautions.</p>

<p>“What should I want with a boy like him? He must be
six years younger than Geraldine, at the very least.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind. And if he was, it wouldn’t
matter. It’s the first time anyone has looked like business,
where Geraldine’s concerned, and with you off my hands I
can afford to make things a bit easy for her. She’s been a
good daughter to me, has Geraldine,” said Mrs. Palmer with
a significant emphasis.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I don’t want to stand in her way,”
Elsie declared contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Anyone less selfish than you are, Elsie, would offer to
help things on a bit. I can’t be for ever asking him here, and
he’s not got the money to take her out a great deal. Why
don’t you get them to meet at your place?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will,” said Elsie slowly.</p>

<p>She was rather silent during tea, mentally reviewing her
mother’s suggestion from various angles.</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison definitely attracted her. She asked him
how long he was to remain in London.</p>

<p>“Not long, Mrs. Williams. I’m doing Bristol and
Gloucestershire next week, and then I’m taking my holiday.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going for that?” Mrs. Palmer enquired.</p>

<p>“I haven’t made up my mind. Anywhere near the sea
is good enough for me.”</p>

<p>“My husband and I are thinking of Torquay,” Elsie said.
“We’ve been wondering if you’d care to come along,
Geraldine. I suppose Mother wants to stew on in London,
as per usual.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Mrs. Palmer assented complacently.
She looked at her younger daughter with approval. It was
the first time, actually, that Elsie had ever invited Geraldine
to spend a holiday with her.</p>

<p>“Torquay is a first-rate place,” declared Leslie Morrison
enthusiastically. “I was there once on business, and I
quite made up my mind to return one day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Thanks very much, Elsie,” Geraldine said rather coldly.
“It’s a long journey, isn’t it, and I’m a wretched traveller,
as you know.”</p>

<p>“Please yourself. Horace wants a thorough change, and
we’re sick of Wales. We’ve been there every year ever
since we were married.”</p>

<p>“Come, I don’t suppose that makes much of a total,
does it?” Morrison gallantly remarked, looking at
Elsie.</p>

<p>“More than you’d think for, perhaps. I was caught
young—eighteen, if you want to know.”</p>

<p>“Elsie,” said her mother abruptly, “have you been to
see your aunties lately?”</p>

<p>She directed the conversation so that no more personalities
were possible, until Elsie rose and said good-bye.</p>

<p>“Allow me,” said Morrison, as he helped her to put on
her coat.</p>

<p>Elsie fumbled for the sleeve-hole until she felt the guiding
pressure of his fingers on her arm.</p>

<p>“Thanks ever so much. Well, good-bye, Mr. Morrison.
Let me know if you come up our way any time.”</p>

<p>“I ... I hope you’re going to let me see you to your
’bus,” he said rather awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Really, there’s no need—I couldn’t think of troubling
you.”</p>

<p>Elsie took no pains to hide that her protest was a purely
conventional one.</p>

<p>“Put on your hat, Geraldine, and go with them. A
walk’ll do you good,” urged Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>But Geraldine, as she frequently did, had turned sulky.
“I’ve got something to do upstairs,” she muttered, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>It was exactly like Geraldine, Elsie thought, to cut off
her nose just to spite her face. Not that it could have made
any difference if she had succeeded in preventing that brief
walk taken by Leslie Morrison and Elsie Williams.</p>

<p>Elsie knew, beyond any possibility of mistake, the very
first moment at which a spark from her own personality had
lit the flame destined to burn more or less fiercely in that of
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>But this time she experienced an odd excitement that
held in it something new.</p>

<p>She wondered, rather wistfully, whether this was because
it was such a long while since she had had any opportunity
of talking to a man other than her husband or one of his
elderly married acquaintances. Her conversation with
Morrison did no more than skirt the edge of personalities
that were implied, rather than spoken. Yet when they parted
Elsie knew, and knew that Morrison knew, that each was
determined to see the other again. She travelled home
in a dream, and hardly heard her husband’s vexed enquiry
as to the reason of her lateness.</p>

<p>Williams had always shown a very strong conviction that
it was a wife’s duty invariably to be at home in time to
welcome her husband’s return from business.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to Hillbourne Terrace.”</p>

<p>“H’m. You’ve made yourself very smart. That hat
suits you, Elsie.”</p>

<p>He so seldom paid a compliment that Elsie was astonished,
and ran to look at herself in the mirror over the dining-room
sideboard.</p>

<p>It was the hat, was it?</p>

<p>Her full face was softly flushed, and her eyes looked
bigger and darker than usual. Elsie saw her own closed
mouth break into an involuntary smile as she gazed at her
reflection. She went up to her room singing softly.</p>

<p>Two days later Leslie Morrison came to see her.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t think I’m taking a liberty. Knowing
your people so well, it seemed quite natural, like, to take
advantage of your kind invitation.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Elsie encouraged him.</p>

<p>She hardly knew what she was saying, but already their
intercourse seemed to be on a plane where conventional
interchanges of words were unnecessary.</p>

<p>Although it was only the second time they had met,
Morrison told her a great deal about himself, and Elsie
listened, with a growing, tremulous tenderness.</p>

<p>He went away before her husband came in, and Elsie
underwent a momentary, essentially superficial, reaction.</p>

<p>“I’m getting soppy about that boy—that’s what I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
doing! Just because he’s got a pair of eyes like—like I
don’t know what. Him and Geraldine! It’s too ridiculous.
Why, he’s younger even than me.”</p>

<p>She reflected that if Morrison, indeed, had been a year or
two older, he would certainly have kissed her by this time.
But it was quite evident to her that such an idea had never
even crossed his mind. He viewed her with obvious admiration,
and with great respect.</p>

<p>The next day Elsie bought a book of poems, about which
Morrison had told her. She read some of them, and it seemed
to her that she had a new understanding of a form of expression
which had never made the least appeal to her before.</p>

<p>“I’m a fool!” Elsie told herself in astonishment, but
with an ominous sensation of strange, new emotions, softer
than any she had yet known, taking possession of her life.
She felt that she would like to give the book to Morrison as
a present, but they had made no definite arrangement for
meeting again, and she could not bring herself to send it
by post. Restlessness possessed her.</p>

<p>It was a relief when one evening her husband began to
speak of their summer holiday.</p>

<p>“We can start on Tuesday, like we planned. Cleaver
gets back on Monday morning, and the sooner we get to the
sea in this weather, the better. It won’t last.”</p>

<p>“It might. September can be a ripping month sometimes,”
said Elsie dreamily.</p>

<p>“That’s your experience, is it? Well, it’s not mine. I
only hope we shan’t have a rainy spell as we did last year,
and sit in an everlasting sitting-room without so much as a
book to look at.”</p>

<p>Elsie shuddered at the recollection. She and Horace had
quarrelled incessantly throughout their last holiday.</p>

<p>“Is your sister coming with us?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’ll be better than nobody. She’ll be somebody
for you to go with to those picture-houses that you’re
so fond of. But it’s a pity that girl hasn’t got a sensible
husband. We might get a decent game of bridge, then.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity you haven’t got any men friends,” Elsie
retorted. “I never knew anybody like you for that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Williams did not answer, but he turned upon his wife a
look, peculiar to himself, that always vaguely frightened
her. It held not only utter contempt, but something of
quiet, unspecified menace.</p>

<p>She hastily spoke again. “Geraldine’s got a—a young
fellow that she thinks is going with her now. A boy
called Morrison.”</p>

<p>“Is he coming to Torquay?”</p>

<p>It was Horace Williams’ own matter-of-course tone in
making the suggestion that suddenly filled Elsie with a
frantic determination to see it carried out.</p>

<p>“Yes, most likely he is. So you’ll get your bridge, I
daresay, and there’ll be somebody to take us to the pictures
of an evening.”</p>

<p>As Elsie said the words, her heart seemed to herself
suddenly to leap against her side, as though in anticipation
of a joy almost too great to be borne.</p>

<p>She lay awake most of that night, revolving schemes by
which Leslie Morrison could be brought to Torquay without
letting Williams know that it was Elsie who had
originated the idea.</p>

<p>Although formerly she had been as much flattered as
irritated by her husband’s suspicious jealousy, it seemed to
Elsie now to be of the utmost importance that he should not
look upon Morrison in any other light than that of Geraldine’s
friend. She wondered if she could induce Geraldine
herself to suggest that Morrison should come to Torquay,
but decided that it was unlikely. Finally, after a great
deal of deliberation, Elsie next day wrote a note to the
young man:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Morrison</span>,</p>

<p>“If not otherwise engaged, we shall be pleased if
you will come to tea on Saturday afternoon. It will be
the last time for some weeks we shall be at home, as we go
to Torquay on the Tuesday. My sister, Miss Palmer, is
coming with us. Why not join the party, as you say you
would like to visit Torquay again?!!!</p>

<p class="right">“Yours sincerely, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>

“<span class="smcap">E. Williams</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Elsie thought about this note incessantly after it was
written and posted, and awaited the reply with proportionate
excitement.</p>

<p>It came by return of post:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Mrs. Williams</span>,</p>

<p>“Very many thanks indeed for your most kind
invitation to tea. Unfortunately I am not able to avail
myself of it, as am already engaged to go to Hillbourne
Terrace. The suggestion about me going to Torquay is
simply great—that is, if you really meant it! I intend
talking it over with your sister when we meet on Saturday.</p>

<p>“Believe me, with kind regards,</p>

<p class="right">“Yours very sincerely, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>

“<span class="smcap">Leslie M. Morrison</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Elsie came downstairs earlier than usual in order to
conceal her letter before Williams should ask to see it, as
he invariably did with his wife’s correspondence.</p>

<p>She put it in her pocket, and kept it there all day. On
Saturday she wanted very much to go to Hillbourne Terrace,
but Williams was at home, and on such occasions he never
expected his wife to go out except with him. They spent
the afternoon drearily enough, Williams reading the newspaper,
and Elsie pretending to sew, and in reality wholly
occupied with speculations as to how Geraldine would
receive Leslie Morrison’s suggestion.</p>

<p>She felt pretty certain that Mrs. Palmer, at all events,
would be in favour of it. “If only he has the sense to make
it sound as if it came from him, and not from me!” thought
Elsie.</p>

<p>She had felt confident of receiving another letter from
Morrison before starting for Torquay, but to her dismay
there was no word, either from him or from Geraldine, and
on the eve of departure she still did not know whether or
not her scheme had succeeded. For the first time, she
heartily wished that there had been a telephone in her
mother’s house.</p>

<p>On the morning of their journey the weather changed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
became suddenly sultry. The train was crowded and
unbearably hot.</p>

<p>Geraldine was to meet them at the station, and the fact
that she arrived late made Horace Williams angry, in his
own unpleasant, silent way. There was only one empty
seat in the railway carriage, which Elsie at once took, and
Williams and Geraldine were forced to stand in the
corridor, already strewn with hand baggage and full of
heated, perspiring people.</p>

<p>The train ran from London to Taunton without a stop,
and at the end of two hours Williams forced his way into
the carriage and spoke quietly to his wife.</p>

<p>“Here, Elsie, give me your place for a little while. One
of my boots is hurting, and I can’t stand any longer. Go
and take your turn for a bit.”</p>

<p>Elsie joined Geraldine in the corridor without demur.
There were certain tones in Horace Williams’ voice that
she had learnt to obey. Geraldine, her face pallid and
shiny with heat, her tight blue cloth dress looking as though
it constricted even her narrow chest and shoulders, was
sitting in an uncomfortable, crouching position on a roll of
rugs.</p>

<p>Both she and Elsie had removed their hats, and while
Elsie’s hair dropped naturally into soft, flattened curls and
rings, Geraldine’s clung damply in straight, short wisps to
her neck and forehead, and she constantly raised her hand
to push away, quite ineffectually, a straggling end that
immediately fell down again.</p>

<p>“Hell, I call this,” she remarked shortly, as Elsie,
stumbling over bags and packages and the feet of other
passengers, reached her side and propped herself up against
the side of the swaying train.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice one to take on a holiday, I must say,”
Elsie retorted, but without acrimony. She felt that
nothing would really matter if she could once get the
assurance that she craved.</p>

<p>“Horace is in a foul temper. He never can stand the
hot weather. I’m sure I hope it’ll be cooler at the sea than
what it is here. Have you brought a new bathing costume,
Geraldine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“M’m. A blue one, with a decent skirt—not one of
those horrible skin-tight things you see in the picture papers.
Improper, I call them.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t be improper if you tried,” said Elsie
cryptically. “Besides, there’ll be nobody to go in the
water with you except me. Horace never bathes—makes
him turn green, or something.”</p>

<p>She eyed her sister carefully as she spoke. Something
in the wariness of Geraldine’s return glance gave her a rising
hope.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I wish we were going to have someone we knew
there. Horace would be much easier to keep in a decent
temper if he had another man to go with sometimes.”</p>

<p>Then Geraldine spoke. “That boy Leslie Morrison said
something about coming down one day this week, and
spending part of his holiday at Torquay. He was awfully
keen I should go and stay with his mother, near Bristol,
too.”</p>

<p>“Was he? Well, you could do that later,” said Elsie.
She was nearly breathless with triumph, but strove to make
her voice sound matter-of-fact. “But I hope to goodness
he will come to Torquay. It’ll make all the difference to
Horace.”</p>

<p>Geraldine sneered. “I daresay you think it’ll make all
the difference to you, too. It’s anything in trousers with
you, old girl, whether the fellow belongs to another girl
or not. But I’m not afraid of anything of that sort while
Horace is about. He knows how to keep you in order, as
Mother said.”</p>

<p>“I’ll thank you, and Mother too, to keep your opinion of
me till it’s asked for.” Elsie, however, spoke mechanically.</p>

<p>She had immediately become obsessed by visions of
herself and Morrison, walking, swimming, sitting beside one
another on the sands, or in the intimate closeness and
darkness of the picture palace....</p>

<p>“I’ll just tell you this, young Elsie. Leslie Morrison
isn’t the sort of fellow you’ve been used to—not like
Johnnie Osborne, and that truck. And as for carrying on
with a married woman—why, he’d be ashamed to think of
such a thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Elsie smiled, and said nothing. She hardly heard what
her sister was saying.</p>

<p>A hand laid upon her shoulder made her jump violently.</p>

<p>“Are you in the moon, Elsie? I’ve been making signs
to you for ten minutes, I should think. It’s more than time
we had our sandwiches,” said Horace Williams querulously.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.”</p>

<p>By tugging and pulling at piled-up packages, they
succeeded in getting hold of the basket in which Elsie had
packed ham sandwiches, seed-cake, and bananas.</p>

<p>The train sped onwards....</p>

<h4>III</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Williamses and Geraldine stayed in a boarding-house
that proudly advertised itself as being situated “right on the
front,” and young Morrison had a room in an apartment
house, much cheaper and more remote, half-way up one of
Torquay’s steepest hills. He arranged to have all his meals
except breakfast at the boarding-house.</p>

<p>The weather was very hot, and sunny, and breathless.</p>

<p>Elsie felt as though she had never lived before. Every
morning she came downstairs, her face sunburnt and glowing,
but never unbecomingly freckled, her open-necked,
short-sleeved blouses and jumpers indefinably smart and
well put on, her undependable and essentially variable good
looks seeming always to increase.</p>

<p>She was greatly admired in the boarding-house, and
Williams for the first time did not appear to resent this.</p>

<p>He had suddenly become absorbed in a new and obscure
digestive complaint, and would discuss the subject endlessly
with his neighbours at meal-times. An elderly
widow without any companion took a fancy to Geraldine,
and as she sometimes gave her presents of clothes, or
took her for a drive, Geraldine always sat next to her at the
long table in the dining-room, and listened to her with a
fair pretence of amiability.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a long, hot, abundant meal. The boarding-house
knew its <i>clientèle</i> and catered for it according to the
views of business men who never allowed themselves to eat
as much as they would have liked on week-day mornings
during all the rest of the year. Tea and coffee, eggs and
bacon, and fish and sausages were provided, toast and jam
and marmalade and potted meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Elsie, who never ate anything but bread-and-butter with
jam, and drank innumerable cups of tea, at her own home,
enjoyed the novel fare because it was novel, and because she
had not bought and ordered it herself, and because she
was living in a haze of happiness that made everything
enjoyable.</p>

<p>The prophecy of the clairvoyante had come true. Elsie
knew the love that she had never yet known.</p>

<p>Every morning they went down to the sands and met
Leslie Morrison there. They sat in deck chairs, and ate
fruit from paper bags, and listened to a pierrot entertainment.
At midday Elsie and Geraldine ran back to the
boarding-house, undressed, and put on their bathing-suits,
and came back to find Morrison already in the water and
Horace Williams asleep in his deck-chair behind a newspaper.</p>

<p>Elsie’s bathing-dress was blue, trimmed with white
braid, and she wore a rubber cap with a blue-and-red
handkerchief knotted over it. Her bare legs and arms and
neck had tanned very slightly; Geraldine’s showed scarlet
patches of sunburn.</p>

<p>As they joined Morrison in the water, both girls always
screamed, clinging to one another’s hands. But once the
water was high above their waists, Elsie, a naturally
strong swimmer, struck out boldly, consciously enjoying the
cold water and the exercise of her muscles. Geraldine, of
poor physique and defective circulation, only bobbed up
and down in the shallows, still uttering staccato shrieks.</p>

<p>At first, Elsie and Morrison would keep near her, swimming
short distances, and then returning, or splashing beside her
in shallow water, but sooner or later they would both strike
out, swimming side by side. They spoke very little.</p>

<p>“I say, you swim simply splendidly, Mrs. Williams.
Why, I’ve never seen a girl swim as well as you do.”</p>

<p>“D’you think so? It’s nice, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It’s ripping. I’ve never had a holiday like this one—I
mean, one that I’ve enjoyed so much.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t looked forward to my holiday a bit this year.
I never thought it would be anything like this. I didn’t
know that anything in the world——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>It was always Elsie who suggested that it was time to go
back.</p>

<p>“Geraldine’s gone out already. She turns a funny
colour if she stays in too long.”</p>

<p>Once, when they were rather further out than usual,
Elsie said that she was getting tired.</p>

<p>“Put your hand on my shoulder—I’ll help you. Yes, do.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you must.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are sure you don’t mind....”</p>

<p>“<i>Mind!</i>”</p>

<p>His voice was very eloquent, and Elsie was abundantly
satisfied.</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon his shoulder, and kept it there
after her feet touched the sandy bottom once more and
they were almost out of the water.</p>

<p>They raced to the bath-towel cloak that she had left
under the wall, and as she put it round her Elsie said, without
looking at him and in a peculiar tone:</p>

<p>“Did you enjoy it?”</p>

<p>“I loved it,” Morrison replied very low, and after a
moment he added:</p>

<p>“Better than any of our other bathes.”</p>

<p>Elsie had never before conducted any one of her numerous
love-affairs in a key so reticent, and the very novelty of the
experience rendered it strange and precious.</p>

<p>Subconsciously, they might both be waiting for the spoken
word, but on the surface each was supremely contented in
the present.</p>

<p>The presence of Geraldine did not disturb Elsie in the
least. Geraldine had been jealous of her intermittently
ever since the days of their earliest childhood, and her
manifestations of temper were always latent, rather than
active. Elsie was used to them, and indifferent to them.</p>

<p>Besides, Leslie Morrison was always very nice to Geraldine.
He sat between the sisters at the entertainments to
which they went frequently, he gave chocolates and sweets
to Geraldine oftener than to Elsie, and he was always ready
to talk of Geraldine’s favourite topic, the old days in the
office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Only his dark eyes sought Elsie’s face with increasing
frequency, his pleasant young voice altered slightly and
indescribably when he found himself alone with her.</p>

<p>It seemed part of the magic of those enchanted days
that Geraldine should make no scene, Horace Williams
appear to perceive nothing.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening a band played in the public gardens.
They decided to go and hear it.</p>

<p>Then Williams developed his mysterious symptoms, and
refused to come out.</p>

<p>“You girls can go with Morrison. I shall take a glass of
boiling water with peppermint,” he declared, “and go to
bed. I’m in agony.”</p>

<p>“Would you like me to stay with you?” Elsie asked, her
heart sinking.</p>

<p>“No, no, go and enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll feel better in a bit, and come and join
us,” she suggested, and thankfully made her escape.</p>

<p>The gardens were lit with Japanese lanterns and crowded
with holiday-makers. Pale frocks and scarves flickered oddly
in and out of the shadows and beyond the bright circle of
glaring white light thrown out from the raised and roofed
circular platform of the bandstand.</p>

<p>“No hope of chairs, I suppose,” said Geraldine disconsolately.
“We’re late, thanks to Horace. Just look
at the people.”</p>

<p>Morrison volunteered to try and find a seat, and they
watched his tall figure disappear into the throng of people.</p>

<p>“I shall be sick if I have to stand for long, that’s
certain,” declared Geraldine. “I believe the sun was too
hot for me this afternoon. My head’s splitting.”</p>

<p>“Take off your hat, why don’t you?”</p>

<p>Elsie’s own hair was only covered with a blue motor
veil, knotted at either ear, and with floating ends.</p>

<p>“My hair would be all over the place. I like to look
tidy, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Please yourself,” said Elsie indifferently. She was
absorbed in watching for the first glimpse of Morrison returning
to them.</p>

<p>When she caught sight of him, elbowing his way through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
the crowd, it actually seemed to her as though the heart in
her body leaped forward to meet him.</p>

<p>As usual, his eyes sought Elsie’s and held them for an
instant before he turned to Geraldine.</p>

<p>“There’s one chair there. I’ve taken it, and a fellow is
kindly keeping it for me. I thought you and your sister
could take it in turns to sit down.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know....” Geraldine began ungraciously.</p>

<p>“It’s quite a good place, and nice-looking people on
either side. The chap that’s keeping it for us seemed very
decent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on, Geraldine!” said Elsie. “Hark, they are
beginning again.”</p>

<p>The band had struck into a selection from a popular
musical comedy.</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison put his arm beneath the girl’s elbow, and
they moved away, Geraldine still grumbling sub-audibly.</p>

<p>Elsie, motionless, waited.</p>

<p>Never before in her life had she known this ecstasy of
anticipation, so poignant as to be almost indistinguishable
from pain.</p>

<p>When Leslie came back to her, she thought that she must
fall, and instinctively caught at his arm for support.</p>

<p>Without speaking, he drew her away from the ring
of light, into the deep shadow of a clump of trees. She
stumbled against something in the sudden obscurity, and
discerned the low railing that separated the ornamental
shrubs and flower-beds from the crowded gravel paths.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Leslie’s voice in her ear, hoarsely. They
stepped together over the little railing on to the grass.
Another few steps, and they were in an isolation as complete
as though a curtain had fallen between them and the
seething mass of talking, laughing, swaying people in the
gardens.</p>

<p>Even the sound of the band only reached them faintly
as though from a great distance.</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison halted abruptly, and they faced one
another, their eyes already accustomed to the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>By an impulse as inevitable as it was irresistible, they
were in one another’s arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Neither spoke a word whilst that long throbbing embrace
endured.</p>

<p>Through Elsie’s whole being flashed the wordless conviction:
“<i>This</i> is what I’ve been waiting for....”</p>

<p>“Elsie,” whispered the man. “Elsie ... Elsie ...
Elsie ... I love you!”</p>

<p>“I love you,” she whispered back again.</p>

<p>They stood clinging to one another, entwined, the hot
summer darkness encompassing them.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” Morrison murmured at last. “I
have no right to say a word to you, Elsie—I never meant to.”</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” said Elsie recklessly. “Horace
and I have never been happy together. I ought never to
have married him. It’s you I belong to.”</p>

<p>“My darling ... my sweetheart.”</p>

<p>They kissed passionately, again and again.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?”</p>

<p>Elsie pressed closer and closer against him. “Forget
everything, as long as this holiday lasts, except that we
can be together. It’s been so heavenly, Leslie! We can
settle—something—later on, when it’s all over.”</p>

<p>“I can’t let you go back to that man again. It would
drive me mad.”</p>

<p>“Take me away with you,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could ... if I only could, little girl!”</p>

<p>They spoke as lovers talk, ardently, and tenderly, and
with long silences.</p>

<p>A sudden surging movement, and the distant sound of
the National Anthem, penetrated at last to them through
the darkness.</p>

<p>“It’s all over!” Morrison cried, aghast. “Your
sister?...”</p>

<p>“I’ll manage her,” said Elsie. “Leslie ... once
more....”</p>

<p>Her mouth found his, and then she tore herself out of
his arms.</p>

<p>“Come with me.”</p>

<p>Rapidly Elsie found her way to the little pay-desk outside
the enclosure, in which the lights were already being
extinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“She’s bound to come out this way.”</p>

<p>They waited, Elsie’s eyes at first dazzled, striving to find
her sister’s form in the crowd. Every fibre of her being was
acutely aware of the presence of Leslie Morrison, standing
just behind her, so that her shoulder touched his breast.</p>

<p>Without turning her head she put out her hand, and felt
it clasped in his and held tightly.</p>

<p>Her senses swam, and it was Geraldine’s own voice that
first warned her of her sister’s approach.</p>

<p>To her relief, Geraldine was talking to a strange young
man.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said amiably.</p>

<p>“Good-night, and thanks so much for a pleasant evening,”
he returned, raising his soft hat.</p>

<p>Elsie compelled herself to speak. “Have you met a
friend?” she enquired, with simulated interest.</p>

<p>“Hallo! Where have you been, I should like to know?
Isn’t it funny?—that’s a fellow who was at our place for
nearly a month during the war. Belcher, his name is. He
was the very one that kept the chair for me. Did you
two get seats somewhere else?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Elsie swiftly.</p>

<p>“It was good, wasn’t it—the band I mean? Horace has
missed something by staying at home.”</p>

<p>Geraldine was evidently, and contrary to her wont, in
high good humour.</p>

<p>They walked back to the boarding-house, Leslie Morrison
between the two girls, Geraldine openly hanging on to his
arm. His other hand was out of sight in his pocket, Elsie’s
warm, soft fingers locked in his.</p>

<p>At the door they parted.</p>

<p>“Good-night and sweet repose,” said Geraldine indifferently,
but she waited for her sister to precede her into
the lighted house.</p>

<p>Elsie moved in a dream. It startled her when Geraldine,
looking curiously at her under the glare of the electric light
in the hall, said suddenly:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Elsie? You look moon-struck,
and your hair’s all over the place, half down your
back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Is it?” Elsie put up her hands and pushed up the
soft, loose mass under her veil again. “I’m going to bed,”
she said, in a voice that sounded oddly in her own ears.
“Tell Horace, will you? I’ve a splitting head.”</p>

<p>She felt an unutterable longing to be in the dark, and alone
with her new and overwhelming bliss.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice one, I must say, leaving me alone all the
evening, and then dashing off upstairs the minute we get in.
I should think Horace would find something to say to
you——”</p>

<p>Elsie neither heard nor heeded.</p>

<p>She ran upstairs and into the small double bedroom.
It contained two beds, and for the first time since their
marriage she and Horace had occupied separate ones.</p>

<p>To-night Elsie felt that she could never be thankful
enough for the comparative solitude that would enable her
to feel herself free again.</p>

<p>She tore off her thin summer clothes, shook down her
cloud of hair, ran across the room in her nightdress to snap
off the light, and then almost threw herself into bed.</p>

<p>In the blessed darkness, Elsie lay with hands clasped over
her throbbing heart, and relived every instant of the evening,
thrilling to a happiness so intense that she felt as though she
must die of it.</p>

<p>She was perfectly incapable just then of looking beyond
the immediate present and the glorious certainty of seeing
Leslie Morrison again in the morning.</p>

<p>Although Elsie had been attracted, in a sensual and
superficial manner, by a number of men, she had never in
her life loved before, and the passion for Morrison that had
suddenly swept into her life held all the force of a long
repressed element violently and unexpectedly liberated.</p>

<p>Body, soul and spirit, she was obsessed almost to madness
by this young man, several years her junior, whom she had
not known a month.</p>

<p>When Horace Williams came up to bed it was nearly
midnight, and Elsie, her face half buried under the sheet,
pretended to be asleep.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>

<h4>IV</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> love-affair of Elsie Williams and Leslie Morrison swept
on its course, and in the early days of their madness neither
of them paused for an instant to count its possible cost.</p>

<p>It seemed, indeed, as though Fate were deliberately
simplifying their way.</p>

<p>Horace Williams appeared unable to give his attention
to anything beyond his newly-discovered digestive trouble,
and remained constantly indoors through the hottest and
finest of the summer days, experimenting upon himself
with drugs, and studying tables of dietetic values. He
questioned Elsie very little as to her movements, taking
it for granted that she, Morrison, and Geraldine formed
a trio.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the youth whom Geraldine had met at
the Sunday evening concert, and whom she spoke of as
Percy Belcher, now almost always made a fourth in the
party.</p>

<p>Geraldine monopolised him eagerly, and openly showed
her triumph at feeling that she could now afford to relinquish
Leslie Morrison.</p>

<p>Elsie and Morrison went swimming together, and
lay on the hot, crowded sands, and dropped behind the
others when they all went for walks, and sat with locked
hands and her cheek against his shoulder in the stifling,
thrilling darkness of the picture theatre, watching together
the representation of a love that was never anything but
the reflection of their own, the eternal triumph of a Man
and a Woman, pale representatives on the screen of Elsie
Williams and Leslie Morrison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>The golden fortnight drew to its close, and with the end
of the Torquay holiday, it suddenly seemed to Elsie as
though the end of the world must come.</p>

<p>“What are we to do, Leslie?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, darling,” he said miserably.</p>

<p>“You’re going to be in town for a bit?”</p>

<p>“For a little while. They’re sending me off again,
pretty soon—abroad this time.”</p>

<p>“I can’t live without seeing you sometimes. Oh, Les,
how can I go back to the old life with Horace after <i>this</i>?”</p>

<p>“Elsie,” said Morrison very low, “would he divorce
you if——?”</p>

<p>“Not a hope. It costs money, and he’s too mean.
Besides, he’d never do it if he thought I wanted it. He’s
cruel, is Horace.”</p>

<p>“Not to you?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t knock me about, if that’s what you mean—he
knows I wouldn’t stand it—but of course he doesn’t
care for me, or for anybody but himself. I was told he
gave his first a rotten time—anyway, I know she used to
look wretched enough. You know there was a first Mrs.
Williams?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. Of course, I saw he was much older
than you. Oh, Elsie, whatever made you marry him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was a fool and I thought I’d like to be married,
and get away from home. I didn’t know what it was
going to be like, that’s certain. Oh, Les, fancy if I was
still Elsie Palmer, and you and me could get married!”
She gave a sob.</p>

<p>“Don’t, sweetheart! I’d have asked for your promise,
fast enough, if you’d been free, but I couldn’t marry any
girl till I’m earning a bit more.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you get a good screw, Leslie?”</p>

<p>“Rotten. But I’m jolly lucky to be in a job at all these
days, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Lucky!” Elsie echoed the word drearily. “You
and I aren’t amongst the lucky ones, boy. I don’t see
how things are ever going to come right for us, without a
miracle happens.”</p>

<p>“He—Williams—may ... he may die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“Not he!” said Elsie bitterly. “There’s nothing the
matter with him. All this talk about indigestion is stuff
and nonsense—just fads he’s got into his head. There’s
nothing wrong with Horace. And it’s always the ones
who aren’t wanted that live on and on. But how am I
going to bear it, after this wonderful time we’ve been
having?” She began to cry.</p>

<p>“Elsie, don’t, darling! I’ll think of a way. There
must be some way out.”</p>

<p>Leslie took her in his arms and she forgot everything
else.</p>

<p>On the last evening they all went to the theatre together,
and it was there, for the first time seeming awake to the
situation, that Horace Williams, sitting at the end of the
row of stalls, suddenly leaned across Geraldine and looked
long and balefully at his wife.</p>

<p>She felt herself changing colour.</p>

<p>Morrison, however, observed nothing. He talked only
to Elsie, looked only at her during the interval, and
whilst the play was in progress and the lights in the theatre
lowered, his hand sought and held hers.</p>

<p>“Elsie, we can’t part like this. How can I see you
alone?”</p>

<p>“We can’t—not here. But Horace starts at the office
again on Wednesday, and he’s there all day. Come to the
house.”</p>

<p>“It means an age without seeing you. Elsie, can I
write to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes ... no....” She was startled. “Oh, Les,
darling, I’d love your letters!... But he’d see them.
Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>She thought rapidly.</p>

<p>“Address them to the post-office—I’ll call there. He
doesn’t know or care what I do all day, so long as I’m
always there in the evenings when he gets back.”</p>

<p>But Elsie was to find herself mistaken. Her husband,
after their return to the suburban villa, displayed a very
unmistakable interest in her movements during the hours
of his absence at work.</p>

<p>He obliged her to give him an account of her day, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
took to ringing her up on the telephone for no acknowledged
reason, and always at a different hour.</p>

<p>At first, Elsie cared little. She and Leslie Morrison met
daily, and on one occasion spent the afternoon in the
country together. Elsie recklessly telephoned to her own
house at seven o’clock that evening, and said that she was
with Irene Tidmarsh, and should not come home that night.</p>

<p>“You must,” said the hollow voice at the other end
of the line.</p>

<p>“I can’t. Her father’s awfully ill, and she’s afraid of
being left.”</p>

<p>“When shall you be home?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come and fetch you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Elsie boldly. “What time?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Williams had rung off.</p>

<p>Elsie knew, beyond the possibility of mistake, that her
husband suspected her; but in the intense excitement
that possessed her she was conscious of nothing so much
as of relief that a crisis should be at hand.</p>

<p>She spent the night with Leslie Morrison at a tiny hotel
in Essex.</p>

<p>Early next morning they travelled back to London,
parting at Liverpool Street station.</p>

<p>“Let me know what happens directly you can, darling,”
urged the man.</p>

<p>“I’ll telephone. Anyway, come round as soon as you
can get away. <i>He</i> won’t be in before seven.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Elsie darling. I’ll never, never forget....”</p>

<p>He left her, joining a hurrying throng of other young men
wearing soft hats and carrying little brown bags, nearly all
of them hastening towards the City.</p>

<p>Elsie proceeded by train and tram to the house of Irene’s
father.</p>

<p>Her friend opened the door to her. “Hullo! I thought
I should see you. That hubby of yours is on the warpath.”</p>

<p>“What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, thanks to me! Come in, Elsie. Have
you had breakfast?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“I’ve had some tea; I don’t want anything else. Tell
me about Horace.”</p>

<p>“Well, Horace, as you call him, saw fit to come round
here at eleven o’clock p.m. last night, and got me out of
my virtuous downy by ringing at the front door bell till
I thought the house was on fire. He said he’d ‘come for’
his wife, if you please!”</p>

<p>“I know. I told him I was going to spend the night at
your place,” said Elsie calmly. “I suppose you didn’t
happen to tumble to it, Ireen?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not known you all these years for nothing, old
girl,” said Irene, grinning. “What do you take me for?
I told him you were in bed and asleep, and had been for
hours.”</p>

<p>“You’re a real sport, Ireen! How did he take it?”</p>

<p>Irene pursed up her lips and shook her head. “He
asked me to tell you to ring him up first thing this morning.
If you ask me, you’re in for trouble. And p’r’aps now you’ll
be so kind as to tell me what it all means, and why on
earth you couldn’t have given me fair warning before
saying you were here. It’s lucky for you I didn’t give the
whole show away on the spot.”</p>

<p>Elsie, habitually ready to discuss any of her love-affairs
with Irene, had told her nothing about Leslie Morrison.
But she saw now that a degree of frankness was inevitable.</p>

<p>Irene listened, sitting on the kitchen table, her shrewd,
cynical gaze fixed upon Elsie. “You’re for it, all right,”
she observed dryly. “I thought directly I saw you after
you’d got back from Torquay that there was something
up. But I somehow didn’t think you’d go off the deep end
like that, Elsie. Why, you’re dotty about him!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Elsie, “I am.”</p>

<p>“And what do you suppose is going to happen?”</p>

<p>Elsie groaned. “I wish to the Lord that Horace would
do the decent thing, or go West—and let me have a chance
of happiness.”</p>

<p>“He won’t,” said Irene. “Well, whatever you do,
don’t make a fool of yourself and run off with this fellow.
It simply isn’t worth it, when he hasn’t got a penny, and
not very often when he has.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“If I thought Horace would divorce me it’d be different,”
Elsie said. She was not listening to Irene at all. “Though
even then, I don’t know what we would live on. Leslie
hasn’t anything except his salary, and that’s tiny, and I’m
sure I couldn’t earn a penny if I tried. Mother wouldn’t
help me, either, if I did a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“No more would anybody else. And surely to goodness,
Elsie, you’d never be such a fool. Think what it would
mean to be disgraced, and have a scandal.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind that with him.”</p>

<p>Irene groaned. “You are far gone! Well, the worse
it is while it lasts, the sooner it’s over. You’ll see sense
again one of these days, I suppose. Meanwhile, you’d
better ’phone that husband of yours.”</p>

<p>Elsie’s conversation with Williams over the telephone
was brief. She agreed to come home at midday, and
neither made any reference to the visit of Williams at
eleven o’clock on the previous night.</p>

<p>Elsie anticipated a scene with her husband, and felt
indifferent to the prospect. She had not enough imagination
to work herself up in advance, and, moreover, her
faculties were entirely occupied with the blissful expectation
of seeing Morrison again that afternoon.</p>

<p>He came some hours after she had arrived home.</p>

<p>Elsie had done some shopping in the morning. With
her husband’s money she had bought a gold-nibbed fountain-pen
for Leslie, and had paid for copies of a photograph
of herself.</p>

<p>She had scarcely ever in her life before given anyone a
present, and Leslie Morrison’s ardent thanks, and rapture
over the photograph, caused her the most acute pleasure.</p>

<p>“Darling, it’s lovely, and it’s just you! I shall
always carry it about with me, done up with your dear
letters.”</p>

<p>“Don’t keep my letters, Leslie,” said Elsie suddenly.</p>

<p>“Why ever not?”</p>

<p>A sudden recollection had come to her ... “<i>Beware of
the written word....</i>”</p>

<p>The medium to whom Irene had once taken her had
said that. She had also said other things; had told Elsie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
that love would come to her.... Perhaps she really
knew....</p>

<p>“I’d rather you didn’t, really,” she said feebly. “Suppose—suppose
Horace ever got hold of them——”</p>

<p>“How could he? Besides, Elsie darling, he’s got to
know about us some time. I wish you’d let me tell him
now. I can’t go on like this; it’s a low-down game coming
to a man’s house without his knowledge and—and making
love to his wife.”</p>

<p>“His wife!” said Elsie angrily. “Don’t call me that.
I may be his wife in law, but it’s you that I really belong
to.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me have it out with him then,” said Morrison
earnestly. “We don’t know, after all. He may be ready
to do the decent thing, and set you free.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you do. I’m pretty sure he guesses....
Horace has always been jealous, though he’s never had
any cause before.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say anything at Torquay?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s since we got back. He asked me once if you
were engaged to Geraldine, and I said no. And he asked
if you meant to come and see us here, and I told him
most likely you would. He didn’t say anything much,
but he hates a man coming near the place, really.”</p>

<p>“I’d far rather have it out with him,” young Morrison
repeated. His face was resolute, and he stood his ground
when Elsie, starting violently, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I believe that’s Horace now! I can hear his key in
the door. He’s never in at this hour as a rule—the skunk,
he’s come to spy on me!”</p>

<p>“Darling, it’s all right!” said Morrison.</p>

<p>He put the photograph away in his breast-pocket with
hands that trembled slightly. Both fixed their eyes on
the door as it opened upon the figure of the little elderly
solicitor. His face wore a no more sardonic expression
than was habitual with him, and Elsie could not deduce
from it whether or not he was surprised to see Leslie
Morrison.</p>

<p>Neither man made any movement towards shaking
hands, but they greeted one another conventionally, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
talked a little, as though indifferently, of the holiday at
Torquay.</p>

<p>Leslie asked whether Mr. Williams was any better in
health, and the solicitor replied coldly:</p>

<p>“No, I am no better. I daresay my case would be a
very interesting one, from the point of view of a doctor.
But I am not one to give up, and I have no doubt that a
great many people do not realise there is anything the
matter with me.”</p>

<p>He turned his eyes upon Elsie for a moment as he spoke.</p>

<p>At the same instant, the inevitable thought that had
flashed through her mind at his words caused Elsie to
cast a lightning glance towards Leslie Morrison.</p>

<p>It was that glance that her husband intercepted.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>

<h4>V</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had another evening together before the storm
broke.</p>

<p>Morrison took Elsie to a dance.</p>

<p>He issued his invitation boldly, in the presence of
Williams, and to Elsie’s secret astonishment, her husband
made no objection to her acceptance.</p>

<p>She wanted terribly to buy a new dress for the dance,
but dared not risk a reminder to her husband, for fear he
should suddenly forbid her to go. Finally she decided to
wear a black dress, covered with black net, and with black
net shoulder-straps. It was not new, but she had seldom
had any occasion for wearing it, and she had enough money
in hand for the housekeeping to enable her to buy a pair
of black artificial silk stockings and slim black satin shoes
with high heels.</p>

<p>Round her thick, light hair she tied a black velvet band
with a spray of forget-me-nots worked in blue silk across
it, but instinct told her to leave her full, beautiful throat
unadorned by any of the few cheap ornaments that she
possessed. Her smooth skin showed a sort of golden glow
that merged imperceptibly into the warm pallor of her
round arms and the dimpled base of her neck.</p>

<p>Elsie looked for a long while at herself in the glass,
rubbed lip-salve into her already scarlet mouth, and,
despite the “Japanesey” effect of lids that seemed half-closed,
wondered at the brilliant light in her own hazel-grey
eyes.</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison came for her, and they left the house
together before Williams arrived from the office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>To both of them it was an unforgettable evening.</p>

<p>Elsie, like all women of her type, was a born dancer.
Nevertheless, before the evening was half over, they had
left the crowded hall for a screened alcove in an upper
gallery, where the reiterated refrain of syncopated airs, and
the wistful rhythm of valse-times, reached them through
the haze of ascending cigarette-smoke.</p>

<p>It was three o’clock when they exchanged a last close,
passionate embrace and Elsie, pale, exhausted, with
indescribably shining eyes, crept upstairs to her room,
undressed, and lay down noiselessly by the side of her
husband to relive the evening that she had spent with
her lover.</p>

<p>Williams left the house next morning without waking
her, but it was that evening that the inevitable crisis came.</p>

<p>The solicitor returned home nearly two hours before
his usual time, and found Leslie Morrison just preparing
to enter the house.</p>

<p>The two men went in together.</p>

<p>Elsie started violently at the sight of her husband, and
then laughed artificially. “Hullo! It’s a case of Oh,
what a surprise, isn’t it? You’re back early, Horace.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her husband.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re not too tired after last night,” Morrison
began.</p>

<p>“Oh no, thanks! It was fine. Horace, I haven’t told
you about the dance yet. It’s a shame you weren’t there.”</p>

<p>The moment she said the words, Elsie knew that she
had made a mistake.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Williams remarked quietly, “you’d have liked
me to be there, wouldn’t you? Well, let me inform you
that you aren’t going to any more dances for the present.”</p>

<p>“Whatever do you mean, Horace?”</p>

<p>“Morrison knows what I mean all right, and so do you,
you little ——” His low, snarling tone gave the effect
of spitting the ugly word at her.</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison sprang to his feet. “Look here, sir——”</p>

<p>The solicitor held up his hand. “That’ll do. It’s not
for you to adopt that tone in speaking to me, you know.
Please to remember that I’m Elsie’s husband.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Look here,” Morrison began again, “I’m perfectly
ready to make a clean breast of it. I do love Elsie. Her
and me were just pals at first, and then I suppose I didn’t
exactly realise where I was drifting. But I’m free to confess
that I lost my head one—one evening a little while ago—and
I told her I loved her.” He glanced at Elsie, as
though for a further cue.</p>

<p>“And of course she told you that she was a pure woman,
and a loving wife, and you must never speak like that
again?” sneered Horace Williams.</p>

<p>“Elsie, don’t let him speak like that.... Tell him!”
urged Morrison.</p>

<p>“I don’t need any telling,” Williams retorted smoothly.
“She thinks she’s in love with you, of course.”</p>

<p>“I am in love with Leslie,” said Elsie suddenly. “And
if you did the decent thing, Horace, you’d set me free to
marry him. You and me have never been happy together.
I didn’t ever ought to have married you, but I was a
young fool.”</p>

<p>“Understand this, the pair of you,” said the little
solicitor clearly and deliberately. “I shall never set you
free, as you call it. You’ve married me, and you’ve got
to stay with me. As for you,” he turned to Leslie Morrison,
“you can leave my house. And understand clearly that
I won’t have you inside it again. And if I catch you
speaking to my wife again, or meeting her, or having anything
whatsoever to do with her, it’ll be the worse for you.”</p>

<p>Morrison took a sudden step forward, his hands clenched,
and Elsie screamed, but Horace Williams stood his ground.</p>

<p>“I’m well within my rights, and you know it,” he
declared. “I could horsewhip you, in fact, and if you
were fool enough to bring a case for assault it’d go against
you. <i>Clear out!</i> That’s my last word to you.”</p>

<p>“Will you let Elsie have a divorce?”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Will you let her have a legal separation, then? You’ve
her own word for it that she’s not happy with you. I’m
not thinking of myself, but you can’t have the cruelty to
keep her tied to you when she’s miserable. Let her have
her freedom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>For all answer, Williams pointed to the door. The
expression of his face had not altered by a hair’s-breadth.</p>

<p>Morrison turned to Elsie, white and tense. “Elsie, you
hear what he says. What d’you want me to do?”</p>

<p>Elsie had lost her nerve. She began to cry hysterically.
Instead of answering Morrison’s appeal, she turned to her
husband.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you let us just be pals, Leslie and me?”
she sobbed. “You bring your horrid, mean jealousy into
everything. I s’pose you don’t grudge me having a friend
of my own age, do you?”</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison instantly and loyally followed her lead.
“If Elsie is kind enough to let me be her friend, and—and
take her out every now and then, and that sort of
thing, I’m willing to forget what’s just passed, and simply
ask you as man to man if you’ve any objection to us being,
as she says, just pals,” he said steadily enough.</p>

<p>“I have every objection. You young fool, Elsie has
just said in so many words that she’s in love with you.
Did you mean that, Elsie, or did you not?”</p>

<p>Elsie sobbed more and more violently, and her voice
rose to an incoherent screech. “How do I know what I
mean or don’t mean, when you make a row like this?
But I’ll tell you this much, anyway, it’s true what he said;
I’m wretched with you, and if you were half a man, you’d
set me free.”</p>

<p>“There, that’s enough,” said Williams. “Going round
and round in a circle won’t help any of us, and you ought
to know by this time, Elsie, that I always mean what I
say. You’ll please to remember what you were when I
married you—a little fool of a typist, without a penny,
whose mother kept a boarding-house and was only too
glad of the money I gave her. It doesn’t take a genius
to say what would have happened to you if you hadn’t
found a man fool enough to marry you, either.”</p>

<p>“Stop that!” Morrison shouted.</p>

<p>The solicitor blinked at him quietly. “I’ve twice told
you to get out of my house,” he observed. “Don’t make
me say it a third time. It’ll be the worse, if you do—for
Elsie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“Are you threatening her, you—you brute, you?”</p>

<p>“I object to your friendship with my wife. That’s all—and
enough too. Now go.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, go!” said Elsie suddenly, breaking into
renewed sobs and tears. “I can’t stand this. You’d
better go, Leslie boy, really you had. I shall do myself in,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like that——” the youth began frantically,
but Williams opened the door, and stood silently pointing
to it.</p>

<p>There was something strangely inexorable in his little,
trivial figure and sinister, passionless expression.</p>

<p>“Elsie,” said Morrison brokenly, “if ever you want me,
send for me. I’ll come!”</p>

<p>He went out of the room, and they heard him go down
the stairs and let himself out at the front door.</p>

<p>“That’s the end of that,” said Williams in a quiet,
satisfied voice. “Stop that howling, Elsie. You didn’t
really suppose that I didn’t know what was going on?”</p>

<p>She sobbed and would not answer.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, and at last Elsie, face downwards
on the sofa, began to feel frightened and curious.
She bore it as long as she could, and then looked up.</p>

<p>Her husband was gazing out of the window, in which a
potted aspidistra stood upon a wicker stand between
soiled white curtains.</p>

<p>At the slight movement that she made he turned his
head. “Elsie, tell me. Did you really mean what you
said, that you’re in love with that boy?”</p>

<p>To her incredulous surprise, his voice had become
hoarse and almost maudlin.</p>

<p>“You only said it to make me angry, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>In a flash Elsie saw the wisdom of allowing him at least
to pretend to such a belief. “Perhaps I did,” she said
slowly. “Anyway, it’s true enough that we aren’t particularly
happy together, and never have been. And I
meant what I said about a separation, right enough,
Horace.”</p>

<p>“You won’t get one,” said Williams, and his voice had
become vicious-sounding once more. “And remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
what I’ve said—that fellow is never to set foot in here
again, and you and he are not to meet in future.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The following morning Elsie went to the High Street
post-office and found there the letter that she had expected.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Own Darling Girlie</span>,</p>

<p>“What is to be done? I can’t tell you, darling,
what a hound I felt to leave you all alone with that jealous
brute yesterday and yet the awful thing is that he has the
right to you and I have none. Oh, Elsie life is hard isn’t
it darling? I wish I could take you away but that cannot
be and it is you that have to bear the brunt of it all
except that I am in hell knowing what you are going through
all the time. Perhaps that is not an expression I ought to
use to you but you must excuse it for I hardly know
what I am writing.</p>

<p>“One of our chaps has gone sick, and they are sending
me to the North instead of him which means we can’t
meet again as I go off to-morrow. But write to me
darling and tell me what it is best to do now. Would it
simplify things if we were to be just friends and no more?</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Elsie perhaps some day things may come
right for us—who knows? He may die; doesn’t he always
say there is something wrong with him?</p>

<p>“A thousand kisses for you, dearie. I have your sweet
photo with me and love to look at it and re-read your
wonderful letters. Write and tell me everything, and what
you think we had better do. Shall we be able to meet
when I come back at the end of the month?</p>

<p>“No more at present, from</p>

<p class="right">“Your own true lover, Leslie, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br>
“<span class="smcap">Boy</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>To Elsie, Leslie Morrison’s love-letters were wonderful.</p>

<p>She read and re-read this one, but when she had answered
it, she burnt it.</p>

<p>Certain words of the clairvoyante, whom she had once
visited with Irene Tidmarsh, she had never been able to
forget, and of late they had haunted her anew.</p>

<p>“<i>Beware of the written word....</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Elsie burnt all Morrison’s letters to her, and asked him
to burn all those that she wrote him.</p>

<p>Gradually these letters that passed between them grew
to be the most important factor in her life.</p>

<p>Elsie, who had detested writing, now desired nothing so
much as to pour out her soul on paper, and the limitations
that she found imposed upon her through lack of education
and the power to express herself made her angry.</p>

<p>Again and again she asked Morrison in her letters to
take her away, and after a time his steadfast refusals bred
in her mind the first unbearable suspicion that her passion
was the greater of the two. Her letters became wilder
and wilder.</p>

<p>Sometimes she threatened suicide, or gave hysterical
and entirely imaginary descriptions of scenes with her
husband; sometimes she expressed a reckless desire for
Horace’s death, or asked if she could “give him something”
unspecified. These phrases, to a large extent, were
meaningless, but Elsie frantically hoped by them to
impress upon Morrison the extent of her love for him.</p>

<p>When he got back from the North of England they met
surreptitiously.</p>

<p>A certain café in a small street not far from Elsie’s home
became their rendezvous. Sometimes Morrison was able
to get there in the middle of the day, but generally he
came at about five o’clock, and they had tea together.
Very occasionally they met early in the afternoon and went
out together.</p>

<p>Each meeting was entirely inconclusive, save in exciting
Elsie almost to frenzy and reducing young Morrison to
further depths of despondency.</p>

<p>The months dragged on. Morrison was often away,
and then he and Elsie wrote to one another daily. She
was entirely obsessed with the thought of her lover, and
hardly ever saw Irene Tidmarsh, or went to Hillbourne
Terrace. And all the while, Horace Williams said nothing.</p>

<p>He and his wife did not quarrel; indeed, they hardly
spoke to one another, but the atmosphere between them,
day by day, was becoming more heavily charged with
mutual hatred and apprehension.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>

<h4>VI</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tension under which Elsie now lived began at last to
affect her health. She slept badly, and was nervous as
she had never been before.</p>

<p>Williams watched her without comment—a sinister little
figure. Sometimes, utterly overwrought, Elsie tried to
force a scene with him, but she only once succeeded in
making him evince anger.</p>

<p>Strangely reckless, she suddenly suggested that Leslie
Morrison should be invited to lodge in their house, with no
slightest expectation that her husband would entertain
such a scheme, but with a wild desire to provoke him to a
scene that should release some of her own pent-up emotion.</p>

<p>“He’s looking for rooms, Geraldine says,” she declared,
“and we’ve a bedroom to spare, and might as well use it.”</p>

<p>Williams gazed at her incredulously. “Are you aware
that I’ve shown Morrison the door once already?” he
asked at last.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m quite aware of that,” said Elsie, with insolence
in her voice. “I thought you might have got more sense
now, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Elsie. I forbade you to speak to that
fellow again—and by God, if you’ve done so, I’ll see you
never forget it!” His face was livid and he spoke through
his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to whom I please.”</p>

<p>“Have you been meeting Morrison?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>Elsie felt a curious pleasure and relief in thus mocking
at the furious jealousy that was evident in her husband’s
face and manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Answer my question.”</p>

<p>She remained silent.</p>

<p>“Are you and that fellow in love?”</p>

<p>“I’ve answered that before. I told you months ago, when
you first started to insult me, that he was nothing to me.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t true then—and it isn’t now. Morrison’s
in love with you, damn him, and you’re in love with him!”</p>

<p>“Am I?”</p>

<p>Elsie laughed derisively in the new and uncomprehended
realisation that she was no longer afraid of Horace.</p>

<p>“You little bitch!...”</p>

<p>He caught her by the shoulders and suddenly flung her
against the wall.</p>

<p>Elsie screamed, but it was reflex action from the physical
shock alone that made her do so. She was neither
frightened nor very much startled. There was even an
odd exhilaration for her in the sudden release of those
pent-up forces that had for so long vibrated tensely between
herself and her husband.</p>

<p>However, her arm and shoulder were bruised, and her
whole body violently jarred. “You’re a coward!” she
panted. “Hitting a woman!”</p>

<p>“You drove me to it.... Elsie, get up!... I’m
sorry I did that, but you’re driving me mad. God, if I
had that fellow here I’d wring the life out of him!”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t,” Elsie taunted him. “He’s a
great deal stronger than you are—he’s a man, he is—you’d
never dare to touch him. All you can do is to knock
a woman about.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie! I’ve never touched you before, though
there’s many a man in my place would have beaten you
within an inch of your life. I didn’t know what I was
doing just now.”</p>

<p>He took a step towards her, but Elsie pulled herself up
from the floor without appearing to notice the movement.
She felt slightly giddy, and her head ached.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to—to forgive me? I oughtn’t to
have hit you, I acknowledge, but you’ve done everything
to drive me to it. Elsie, swear to me that there’s nothing
now between you and Morrison.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Oh, all right,” she said wearily. “I swear it.” She
felt that she no longer cared what happened in a sudden
overwhelming fatigue.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you,” said Williams bitterly.</p>

<p>Elsie shrugged her shoulders, and turned, moving
stiffly, to leave the room.</p>

<p>“Are you—are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I am. My shoulder will be black and
blue to-morrow, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Shall I get you anything?” Williams muttered,
shamefaced.</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>That afternoon Elsie rang up Leslie Morrison on the telephone
after her husband had gone out. “Is that you, Les?”</p>

<p>“Yes. How’s yourself?”</p>

<p>He had told her never to be prodigal of verbal endearments
in their telephone communications, and she knew
that he was probably not alone, but it struck her painfully
that his tone was a purely casual one, such as he might
have used to anyone.</p>

<p>“We’ve had an awful scene, boy.”</p>

<p>“What—who?”</p>

<p>“Him—Horace—and me. The same old thing, of course—jealousy.
I stood up to him, and told him I didn’t
intend to put up with that sort of treatment any longer,
and I’d never give up anyone I—I liked.”</p>

<p>“I say, Elsie, you were careful, weren’t you?” asked
Morrison, his voice grown anxious.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, darling, of course I was, for your sake. But
Leslie—this is what happened—he knocked me down.”</p>

<p>There was a smothered exclamation that made her heart
leap with sudden exultation. Of course Leslie cared....</p>

<p>“Elsie—girlie—he didn’t! Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>She could have laughed in pure joy at his sharply-anxious
question.</p>

<p>“Nothing bad. Shaken, of course, and I expect there’ll
be a bad bruise, but I can put up with worse than that,
you know.”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to have to! The hound! I’d like to....
Look here, can’t we meet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“Yes, yes!” she said eagerly. “What about tea?
I’ll come to——”</p>

<p>“The same place,” he interrupted quickly, and she
understood that he did not want her to mention the name
of the tea-shop that had so often served them as rendezvous.</p>

<p>“What time?”</p>

<p>“About half-past five. I shan’t get away any earlier.”</p>

<p>“All right, darling. I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>“Sure you’re all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite all right now,” Elsie declared, laughing
happily.</p>

<p>“I must go. See you later, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Good-bye, boy.”</p>

<p>The answering good-bye came to her faintly over the
wires as the final click warned her that he had hung up
the receiver.</p>

<p>Elsie looked at the clock on the mantelpiece. Only three
o’clock—two hours and a quarter before she could think
of starting out.</p>

<p>The telephone rang again, and Elsie, with a joyful hope
that Morrison had been unable to resist a further word,
snatched at the instrument.</p>

<p>“Hallo, hallo! Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“I am—Horace,” said her husband’s flat, nasal voice.
“Look here. How would you like to go to the play to-night,
Elsie?”</p>

<p>“What!” said Elsie, disappointed at not hearing Leslie
Morrison’s voice again, and still dazed from the scene of
the morning.</p>

<p>“I said, how would you like to do a theatre to-night?
I’ve got tickets for ‘The Girl on the Pier’—good places—for
to-night.”</p>

<p>She understood at last that he was seeking to propitiate
her, and to make up for his violence. “I don’t mind.
What time does it start?”</p>

<p>“Half-past eight, but we’d better meet in town somewhere
for some food. I shan’t have time to come home
first. What about the Corner House, at about seven
o’clock? That’ll give us plenty of time to go on to Shaftesbury
Avenue afterwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“All right. How many tickets have you got, Horace?”</p>

<p>“Just the two. I thought you and I would go by
ourselves and have a jolly evening,” said the far-away
voice rather tremulously.</p>

<p>Elsie laughed drearily as she rang off.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the time dragged interminably
until she could go upstairs and dress herself for the evening’s
outing. She meant to meet Morrison first and then go on
to the Corner House and wait there for her husband.</p>

<p>Elsie put on a dark blue coat and skirt, with a new pale
blue jumper of artificial silk, and a big black hat with a
blue feather. Round her neck she wore a small black fur.</p>

<p>After her variable wont, she had suddenly recovered her
looks, after the sodden, stupefied ugliness that the morning’s
unhappiness had produced in her. Her eyes seemed more
widely opened than usual, her hair fell into thick curls and
rings, and a soft, bright colour lay under her oddly prominent
cheek-bones. She rubbed lip-stick on to her full,
sulkily-cut mouth, and lavishly powdered her straight,
beautiful neck. The glow of excitement and gladness
transformed her as she went out to meet Morrison, slamming
the door of the villa behind her.</p>

<p>“Darling!”</p>

<p>“My own dear little girl!” said Leslie, and held both
her gloved hands for a moment in his. “I haven’t been
able to think of anything but what you told me this afternoon.
Are we going for a walk, or will you come in?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to come in and sit down,” said Elsie languidly.
“Have you had tea?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ll order some.”</p>

<p>“Not for me, boy. I’m meeting Horace for a meal in
about an hour and a half. We’re going to the theatre.”</p>

<p>“Have you made it up, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so! He telephoned and said he had these
tickets. I suppose he thought it’d make up, in a way.”</p>

<p>They chose a corner table at the further end of the tea-shop,
and Elsie took off her coat and leant against it as it
lay folded over the back of her chair.</p>

<p>“Where did he hurt you this morning?” said Morrison
intently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>She pulled up the loose sleeve of her silk jumper.
“Look!”</p>

<p>Her smooth, soft arm was already discoloured all round
the elbow and up to the shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’s worse higher up, only I can’t get at it now to
show you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Damn</i> him!” Leslie Morrison muttered between his
teeth.</p>

<p>His boyish face was black with an intensity of feeling
that Elsie had seldom seen there of late. It sent a rush
of joyful reassurance all through her.</p>

<p>“Darling, I don’t care about anything while we’ve got
each other.”</p>

<p>“But it can’t go on, Elsie. He’s making your life
miserable. Isn’t there any hope of a divorce, or even a
separation?”</p>

<p>“He says he never will.”</p>

<p>Elsie spoke slowly. She was revolving a possibility,
that she had often viewed before in her own mind.</p>

<p>“Les, can’t we go away together? I don’t care what
happens, or what people think of me. I’d face anything,
with you.”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, she knew—and one side of her was
relieved to know—that Morrison would negative the
suggestion, as he had often done before.</p>

<p>“Out of the question, darling girl. Think what I’m
getting—two twenty-five a year and no particular prospect
of a rise for years to come. And look at what you’ve been
used to!”</p>

<p>“Not before I married.”</p>

<p>“Times were different then. It was before the war.
Living has gone up five hundred per cent. since then, and
it’ll be many a long year before it comes down again.
Why, Elsie, we couldn’t even live!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you think I’m living now!”
she exclaimed vehemently. “Existing, I call it. And we
shall only be young once, Leslie, and it seems so hard to
waste it all.”</p>

<p>He groaned, and they sat silent for a time, their hands
locked together beneath the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Would you be ready to—to end it all?” she asked
suddenly. “I mean for us to go out together, right out
of life?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean suicide?”</p>

<p>“Yes—a suicide pact.”</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes upon him, anxious to believe that he
was startled, and acutely touched, at the lengths to which
her love could carry her. The actual idea behind the
word—that of suicide—conveyed very little to her. Although
she believed herself to be fully in earnest, Elsie
never seriously contemplated her own death, nor that of
her lover.</p>

<p>She had often thought of Williams’s death as the one
possible solution of their problem, but she had actually
never really abandoned the secret expectation that a way
out would be found for herself and Morrison that would
secure their happiness.</p>

<p>She had read of suicide-pacts, and seized upon the idea
eagerly as one more peg upon which to hang the proofs of
her passion for Morrison, and maintain his love, and his
interest in herself, at the level of her own ardour. Although
never consciously owning it to herself, Elsie knew
that his love was a lesser one than hers.</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison, now, did not make the passionate
response for which she had hoped. “Don’t talk like that.
Oh, Elsie, it is hard, isn’t it? And you don’t know what
it’s like for me to think of that brute making your life
miserable. If only there was anything I could do!...
I think about it till I see red sometimes. Why doesn’t
he die?”</p>

<p>“Because we want him to, I suppose,” said Elsie,
suddenly listless. “He’s always talking about his health
failing, and things like that, but I don’t see any sign of it
myself. Things will never come right for us in this world,
Leslie.”</p>

<p>“Elsie, I’ll make him get a separation; I swear I will.
It’s the only possible thing. Then at least you’ll be free.”</p>

<p>She noticed that he did not refer to the separation
between herself and her husband as to a means of furthering
their own love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Haven’t your people ever tried to get your freedom
for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve nobody much, you know! Only mother and
Geraldine, and the old aunties. They don’t approve of
me either—never did.”</p>

<p>“Poor little girl, they don’t understand you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care while I’ve got you, Leslie.”</p>

<p>They made love to one another, their voices low, until
Morrison reminded Elsie suddenly that it was late.</p>

<p>“You’ll hardly get to the West End by seven now. I’m
glad you’re going to enjoy yourself to-night, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I wish we were going together, Les, just you and I.
That’s how it ought to be. Are we going to meet to-morrow,
dearest?”</p>

<p>“Lunch here, can you? One o’clock. And meanwhile,
darling, I’m going to think hard what I can do to
make things better for you. He’s got to stop leading you
this sort of life, anyway, and it’s up to me to find a way of
making him do so. When I think of his knocking you
about....”</p>

<p>The blood rushed into his face, and Elsie saw that he
had clenched his hand involuntarily. It was balm to her
to realise that she still had the power of exciting him to a
frenzied anxiety on her account.</p>

<p>“He’s hit me before now, you know,” she said suddenly,
hardly realising, and caring not at all, that she was not
speaking the truth.</p>

<p>“You never told me. I’ve sometimes wondered....”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to say anything about it. I knew it
would upset you.... Never mind, darling, I don’t
care.”</p>

<p>“But I do. I tell you it’s driving me mad. Oh, what’s
the good of talking when one can’t do anything! Look
here, darling, I’m not fit to talk to you now—and besides,
you’ll be frightfully late. I shall see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“One o’clock. Good-night, sweetheart. I wish it was
you and me going to this show to-night. Wouldn’t it be
heaven!”</p>

<p>“Indeed it would. But things may come right for us
even yet, darling—don’t give up hope. Good-bye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Good-bye!” she echoed.</p>

<p>Elsie was late for her appointment with her husband,
but he did not complain. He seemed anxious to do everything
in his power to conciliate her, and it was characteristic
of their relations together that, as her fear of his sarcastic
petulance vanished, so her contempt for him increased.</p>

<p>“I got dress-circle places,” said Williams impressively.
“I know you like them.”</p>

<p>The piece, a musical comedy, amused her, and she was
pleased at various glances that were cast upon her by their
neighbours in the theatre. At the back of it all was a
warm inward glow that pervaded all her consciousness at
the remembrance of Leslie Morrison’s championship of her,
his assurance that he would “think out a way.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Leslie would make up his mind to take her
away. She had asked him to do so, and he had always
refused. Elsie, with an ever-latent fear that Morrison was
already beginning to tire of an attachment that to her was
the one reality in life, told herself passionately that, with
him, she would care nothing for poverty.</p>

<p>“It’s good, isn’t it?” said her husband’s nasal voice.</p>

<p>“Rather. Topping!”</p>

<p>For a minute or two she listened to the comedian on the
stage, and was genuinely amused by his facial contortions
and wilful mispronunciations of polysyllabic words.</p>

<p>“He’s so silly, you can’t help laughing at him,” Elsie
declared, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>Then she drifted back again into the dream wherein she
and Leslie Morrison figured as sole protagonists, with
complete and unexplained elimination of Horace Williams.</p>

<p>“Look who’s here, Elsie!”</p>

<p>She started violently, convinced against all reason that
she would see Morrison.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that your aunties?”</p>

<p>“So it is,” said Elsie without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Aunt Ada and Aunt Gertie were making violent signs to
her, and in the interval Horace, still evidently bent upon
doing everything possible to please her, insisted upon going
to speak to them, and suggested supper after the play.</p>

<p>“He is going it,” Elsie reflected dispassionately, not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the least touched, but a good deal amazed at the lavishness
of Horace’s amends.</p>

<p>She was in reality very much bored by the company of
the two aunts in the little restaurant to which they eventually
went.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go and see your poor mother, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“I do see her, Aunt Gertie.”</p>

<p>“Not very often, dear.”</p>

<p>“As often as I’ve time for,” said Elsie curtly.</p>

<p>“Geraldine’s not looking well,” Aunt Ada began next.</p>

<p>“What happened to that young fellow she was supposed
to be going with last year?”</p>

<p>Horace Williams called abruptly for his bill. “It’s after
twelve, and I’ve got to be at work to-morrow, if you
ladies haven’t. All good things must come to an end,
you know.”</p>

<p>“It’s been most pleasant, I’m sure,” said Aunt Gertie.</p>

<p>And when Horace had gone to pay the account at the
cash-desk, she added sentimentally to Elsie:</p>

<p>“It’s a real pleasure to have seen you and him together—and
so happy.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Elsie sarcastically. “We’re as happy
as the day is long, of course.”</p>

<p>“So you ought to be,” said Aunt Ada very sharply.</p>

<p>They exchanged good-byes outside the restaurant, and
Elsie and her husband went by Tube to their own station.</p>

<p>The long suburban road was almost deserted when they
came out into it.</p>

<p>“We’ll go by the Grove, of course,” said Elsie, indicating
the narrow alleyway that eventually merged into their own
street, with a high blank wall upon one side of it and the
backs of a rather sordid row of houses upon the other.</p>

<p>A few leafless plane-trees showed above the top of the
wall, and an occasional tall lamp slightly relieved the
gloom of the long, paved passage-way.</p>

<p>Their footsteps on the stones were clearly audible in the
unusual stillness that belonged both to the deserted
locality and to the small hours of the morning.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” said Horace so suddenly that Elsie
jumped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Footsteps were hurrying behind them, and they both
turned. With a strange sense of foreknowledge, Elsie saw
Leslie Morrison.</p>

<p>The two men stopped dead as they came face to face
with one another. Elsie shrank back against the high
yellow brick wall, her eyes fixed upon Morrison’s ravaged
face.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t rest for thinking of it all. I know what
happened to-day, Williams,” he said in a high, strained
voice. “It can’t go on. You’re making Elsie’s life hell.
Give her her freedom.”</p>

<p>“Damn you! Who are you to interfere between man
and wife?” said Williams, low and fiercely. “I know
what you want, both of you, but you won’t have it. Elsie’s
my wife, and I shan’t let her go.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to.”</p>

<p>Horace Williams, looking full at the youth, who was
shaking from head to foot with excitement, gave his low,
malevolent laugh.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant Elsie heard her own voice
screaming, “Don’t ... don’t...!” and saw the flash
of a knife as Morrison raised his arm and struck again and
again.</p>

<p>Williams spun round as though to run, and his eyes,
oddly surprised-looking, glared, straight and unseeing, at
Elsie.</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison stabbed at him again in the back.</p>

<p>“What have you done?” sobbed Elsie to Morrison.
“Oh, go!”</p>

<p>She saw Morrison dash away up the passage, and at the
same moment Horace Williams took a few steps forward.</p>

<p>“Keep up—I’ll help you!” gasped Elsie.</p>

<p>She thrust her arm beneath his elbow, dimly astonished
and relieved to find that he was walking, when he suddenly
lurched heavily against her, the upper part of his body
sagging forward. Then he fell heavily and lay motionless,
blood trickling from his mouth.</p>

<p>Elsie, utterly distraught, and her knees shaking under
her, felt her screams strangled in her throat. A distant
figure showed at the near end of the alley, and she flew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
rather than ran, towards the stranger, calling out in a
high, sobbing voice for a doctor—for help.</p>

<p>The woman, elderly and respectable-looking, asked what
had happened.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Elsie. A blind horror was upon
her, but instinct warned her to make no definite statement
of any kind.</p>

<p>A nightmare confusion followed. The alleyway, from
being a silent and deserted spot, became clamorous with
footsteps and voices. Elsie dimly heard a tall man in
evening clothes saying that he was a doctor, and saw him
kneel beside the blood-spattered form huddled upon the
pavement. It was he, and a stalwart policeman, who finally
lifted that which had been Horace Williams on to a hand-ambulance
and took it away.</p>

<p>Another man in police uniform took Elsie’s arm, giving
her the support that alone enabled her to move, and helped
her to a taxi.</p>

<p>She almost fell into it, weeping hysterically, and he
took his place beside her as a matter of course. In the
sick, convulsed terror that shook her, his stolid presence was
an actual relief. She thought that he was taking her
home until he gently explained that she was coming with
him to the police-station.</p>

<p>“We want to get this cleared up, you know, and you
can help us by telling us just what happened.”</p>

<p>A new and more dreadful fear came over her. If
Horace was dead someone would be accused of having
killed him. They might suspect her.... Elsie felt as
though she were going mad with the horror of it all.</p>

<p>She began hysterically to scream and cry.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>

<h4>VII</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was still early in the day when Elsie’s mother came to
her at the police-station. Her fat face was white, stained
and mottled with tears.</p>

<p>“It seems too bad to be true,” she kept on repeating
again and again. “That’s what I said when I heard about
poor Horace: too bad to be true. And you in this dreadful
place, Elsie, and such a state as you’re in—and no wonder.
The whole thing seems too bad to be true.”</p>

<p>“Have they—found anything? Shall I be able to go
home soon?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, dearie. They’ve got to find out who
killed poor Horace, you know. Elsie, you’ve always been
a sensible girl. You must tell them all you know, however
dreadful to you it is to speak of such things. Or I’ll tell
them for you, if you’d rather just have it out with mother.
Didn’t you see anyone?”</p>

<p>“Someone flew past, and as I turned to speak to Horace,
I saw the blood coming out of his mouth.”</p>

<p>“Who was it flew past?” said Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It all happened in a flash, like,” said
Elsie.</p>

<p>“You and Horace were happy together, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, always,” said Elsie stolidly. She had made up
her mind not to say anything else.</p>

<p>“You didn’t quarrel?”</p>

<p>“No, never.”</p>

<p>“You’ll tell them that, won’t you, dearie? The police,
I mean.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing to do with them,” said Elsie childishly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Now don’t talk that way. That’s silly. You don’t
seem to realise, my lady, the sort of mess you’re in.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer’s voice rose to stridency as she let her fear
and her temper get the mastery of her attempt at caution.</p>

<p>“My God, Elsie, can’t you see what it means? They
may try you for murder. Murder—the same as the horrid
common people in the newspapers. Who’s to know what
happened—you and Horace in that empty street at one
o’clock in the morning, and he gets done in, and whatever
you may say—and mind you, I’ll back you up in it-they’ll
get hold of the fact that you and poor Horace
didn’t hit it off together.”</p>

<p>“We were quite happy together.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Mrs. Palmer approvingly. “You
stick to that.”</p>

<p>Then she began to cry. “To think it should have come to
this! I that have always held my head high—I don’t know
what your aunts will say! It’ll be an awful shock for them.”</p>

<p>Elsie hardly heard what her mother was saying. Waves
of physical nausea kept on passing over her, and she was
conscious of nothing but thankfulness when an elderly
woman in uniform came to her with a cup of tea, and
suggested that she should lie down and get some sleep.</p>

<p>Elsie followed her, scarcely replying to Mrs. Palmer’s
voluble farewell and assurances of her own speedy return.</p>

<p>She could not afterwards have told where it was that
she was taken, but a small, narrow bed awaited her, and
she flung herself on to it and fell almost at once into the
trance-like sleep of utter bodily and mental exhaustion.</p>

<p>The same uniformed woman was waiting for her when
she woke, after several hours, and the sight of her brought
back in a sick rush the horrors of the morning.</p>

<p>“Oh, I must go home!” cried Elsie.</p>

<p>The woman took very little notice of her words, but she
conducted her to a lavatory and helped her to make her
toilette.</p>

<p>Cold water and the effects of sleep combined slightly to
steady the wretched Elsie. “I should like to go home at
once, please,” she said, in a voice that she tried in vain to
render firm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Yes. Well, I daresay your mother will take you away
as soon as you’ve answered a few questions,” said the
woman indifferently and quietly. “They want you
downstairs first for a few minutes now.”</p>

<p>“Is Mother there?”</p>

<p>“She’s in the waiting-room. You’ll be able to see her
afterwards.”</p>

<p>“<i>Afterwards?</i>”</p>

<p>Elsie’s agonised perceptions fastened upon that one
word. She sought with frantic and irrational intensity to
pierce the veiled threat that she felt it to convey.</p>

<p>A man whom she knew to be a police-inspector appeared
at an open door, and the uniformed woman went away.</p>

<p>“Now, Mrs. Williams, I’m afraid we must trouble you
for a short statement,” said the man pleasantly. “Will
you follow me, if you please?”</p>

<p>He moved forward, and Elsie saw into the room that he
had just left.</p>

<p>Leslie Morrison was within it.</p>

<p>As their eyes met, it seemed to Elsie that the last shreds
of self-control deserted her, and she screamed on a high
and hideous note words that came incoherently and
frenziedly from some power outside herself.</p>

<p>“Leslie, Leslie! Oh, God, what shall I do? Why did
you do it? I didn’t ever mean you to do it.... I must
tell the truth....”</p>

<p>The inspector swung sharply round and gripped her by
the arm. “Do you realise what you’re saying? It is my
duty to caution you that anything you say now may be
used in evidence against you.”</p>

<p>Elsie burst into hysterical sobs and tears.</p>

<p>The man pushed her gently into another room where
another official and a young man in plain clothes sat at a
table with papers and pens in front of them.</p>

<p>The interrogatory that followed was conducted with
grave suavity by the senior official, but Elsie was conscious
only of a horror of committing herself.</p>

<p>She said again and again that she and her husband had
always been happy together.</p>

<p>It was a faint relief when at last they came to actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
questions of fact, and she could reply with direct statements
to the enquiries as to her movements on the previous
evening.</p>

<p>(O God, was it only last night that she and Horace had
gone to the theatre—only <i>this morning</i> that they had
started to walk home from the Tube station?)</p>

<p>“Mrs. Williams, I want you to tell me in your own
words exactly what happened in the alleyway just before
your husband was struck.”</p>

<p>Elsie realised with despair that she must say something.</p>

<p>She was not imaginative, but almost without her own
knowledge she had evolved a sort of account by which, it
seemed to her, confusedly, that she might safeguard herself.</p>

<p>“We were walking along,” she said in a trembling,
almost inaudible voice, “and there wasn’t anybody in sight,
and suddenly someone rushed up from behind and pushed
me away from my husband. I was sort of dazed for a
moment—I think I must have been pushed against the
wall—and when I recovered I saw Horace—my husband—struggling
with a man. Then the man ran away.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the man’s face?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Elsie, with ashen lips.</p>

<p>“But you know who it was?”</p>

<p>“It was Leslie Morrison.”</p>

<p>The room reeled before her eyes, and she made an ineffectual
clutch at a chair.</p>

<p>Through a sort of thick fog she heard the official repeating
in a low tone: “It was the man known as Leslie
Morrison.”</p>

<p>Then she felt herself fall.</p>

<p>Her mother was with her when she recovered consciousness,
and the woman who had attended to her before, and
whom Mrs. Palmer now repeatedly and volubly addressed
as “Matron.”</p>

<p>Elsie looked round her, but the officials were gone.
With a groan she let her head drop backwards again on to
the rail of the chair in which she found herself.</p>

<p>“Come along now, don’t give way. You’re better now,”
said the matron briskly. “Don’t let yourself go, Mrs.
Williams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Oh, Elsie, Elsie,” wailed Mrs. Palmer, “whatever will
become of us? Didn’t I always tell you——”</p>

<p>“Give her an arm, Mrs. Palmer, and I’ll take her on the
other side, and we’ll get her into the other room. There’s
a nice couch there, and she can lie down a bit.”</p>

<p>They half led, half dragged Elsie away, the matron
exhorting her all the time with impersonal, professional
brightness to pull herself together.</p>

<p>She was conscious of thankfulness when the woman left
her alone with her mother, although leaving the door open
behind her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer instantly bent forward and asked with
avidity: “What did you say to them, Elsie?”</p>

<p>“Let me alone, Mother, for pity’s sake!”</p>

<p>“How can I let you alone, as you call it, you unnatural
girl? What a way to speak to your own mother, on
whom you’re bringing sorrow and shame, and may bring
worse yet, if you’re not careful! Now you tell me this,
Elsie Williams, directly this minute: Did you or did you not
tell them that you and Horace were on bad terms
together?”</p>

<p>“I said we were quite happy together——”</p>

<p>“Stick to that,” said Mrs. Palmer significantly. “Did
anyone know—any neighbour or anybody—that you
quarrelled? He never made a row, or knocked you
about, did he?”</p>

<p>“Only the once,” Elsie said automatically.</p>

<p>She pushed up her sleeve, then shuddered violently as
she recalled that she had last made use of that same gesture
in the tea-shop with Morrison.</p>

<p>“My goodness, did Horace do that? You must have
tried him pretty high, <i>I</i> know. How are you going to
account for that bruise, young Elsie?”</p>

<p>“Who’s to know about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll find out fast enough! They get to know
about everything. Look here, did you say that you’d
been pushed against the wall by whoever it was who did
in poor Horace?”</p>

<p>Elsie nodded, too much stunned even to wonder how her
mother had become possessed of this information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Very well, then. Those bruises on your arm are
where you fell against that wall. Don’t forget. I shall
say you showed them to me, and told me about it.”</p>

<p>“Say what—when?” Elsie asked stupidly. “I suppose
all this’ll be over before I’m quite mad, and they’ll let me
go home to-day.”</p>

<p>Her mother’s fat face puckered up suddenly, and she
began to cry with loud, gulping sobs. “I don’t know!”
she wailed. “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“But what—what—for Heaven’s sake, Mother, stop that
noise, and tell me what they’re going to do. <i>What is it?</i>”
almost shrieked Elsie, striving to fight down the panic that
threatened to overwhelm her.</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand, you little fool? (God forgive
me for speaking like that!) Oh, Elsie, I’m afraid—I’m
afraid they’ll—they’ll arrest you—for murder!”</p>

<p>“Don’t use that word!” almost screamed Elsie.</p>

<p>“How can I help it? Murder’s what’s been done, and
it lies between you and that fellow Morrison. Elsie, how
far have things gone between you and him? But there, I
needn’t ask. I know you.” Mrs. Palmer wept convulsively.</p>

<p>She remained with her daughter until late in the afternoon,
and twice during that time Elsie was summoned to
a further interrogatory. She learnt that Morrison’s knife
had been found close to the alley, and that he had been
fetched from his office early in the day and taken away
by the police.</p>

<p>It was after her mother had gone away, as the dusk was
gathering, that Elsie Williams and Leslie Morrison were
charged together with the wilful murder of Horace
Williams.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“For God’s sake, Mrs. Williams, tell me the whole
truth!”</p>

<p>Elsie looked dumbly at Mr. Cleaver, too sick with fright
to speak.</p>

<p>“Do you understand that you’re in the most frightful
danger?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>A sound that just amounted to an interrogation forced
its way between her dry lips.</p>

<p>“You know what the sentence is for anyone found guilty
of wilful murder?”</p>

<p>Elsie screamed and shrank.</p>

<p>Cleaver bent forward, deep dents coming and going at
the corners of his nostrils, his white face working with
earnestness. She could see the sweat shining upon his
forehead.</p>

<p>“Try and understand. You will be committed for
trial for the murder of your husband.”</p>

<p>“But Leslie Morrison....”</p>

<p>“He’s in the same boat. His one idea, it seems, is to
shield you—to pay the whole of the penalty himself.”</p>

<p>“It was him who—who....” Elsie’s voice trailed
away.</p>

<p>“I know. But who inspired him to do it, Mrs. Williams?
I tell you that nothing but absolute frankness can
give you a chance.”</p>

<p>“Shall I be in the witness-box?”</p>

<p>A bewildered idea that she could still make use of her
charm to serve her present cause made Elsie ask the
question.</p>

<p>“You will be in the dock,” said Cleaver grimly. “Understand
that everything—your life itself—depends upon
your being absolutely straightforward with me. Don’t
conceal anything—don’t attempt to. I tell you, it’s your
one hope.”</p>

<p>Elsie stared and stared at Mr. Cleaver. “I never meant
Leslie to do it!” she cried suddenly and wildly.</p>

<p>“But you knew he was going to?”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Williams, tell me the truth. You and Morrison
were madly in love with one another, and had been for
over a year?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“You knew that your husband would never, in any
circumstances, set you free?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We asked him, begged him to. He—he was
very cruel, Mr. Cleaver.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“You and Morrison would not face open scandal by
going away together?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that.”</p>

<p>“What was it, then?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, twisting her handkerchief round and
round in her fingers.</p>

<p>The solicitor moistened his lips with his tongue. “Your
only hope, your one and only hope in this world, Mrs.
Williams, is to speak the truth. I’m powerless to help
you if you won’t be open. Don’t be afraid that everything
you say now will come out in the police-court; it won’t
necessarily be so at all—far from it. But I can judge of
nothing unless I know every single thing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said Elsie, white to the lips.</p>

<p>“Why would you and Morrison not have gone away
together? Were you afraid?”</p>

<p>“We had no money.”</p>

<p>“I see. Morrison’s pay was very small, and you had
nothing but what your husband gave you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Whereas if you were a widow, you had reason to suppose
that Williams would leave you comfortably provided for?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did it not occur to you, then, that his death would be
a very convenient solution of the whole problem?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! How could I help thinking that?”</p>

<p>“You not only thought it, Mrs. Williams, you said it,
and you wrote it.”</p>

<p>“I never——” The denial sprang from her quite
instinctively.</p>

<p>Mr. Cleaver put up his hand authoritatively. “Wait!
Do you remember a conversation with a friend of yours,
Miss Irene Tidmarsh, on the eighteenth of last October,
when you made use of the words, ‘I wish to the Lord that
Horace would do the decent thing or go West, and let me
have a chance of happiness’?”</p>

<p>Elsie was terrified at the precision with which her very
words were quoted and the occasion known. “I can’t
remember,” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Williams, you <i>must</i> speak the truth. Remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
that a great deal is known already, and banish any idea of
false shame from your mind. This is a question of life and
death to you: neither more nor less. If I know the truth
from you, I can advise you as to the line you must take
under cross-examination. Remember that it will be a
terrible ordeal for you, and it’s essential that you should
be properly prepared for it. And weight will be attached,
without a doubt, to that conversation of yours with Miss
Tidmarsh.”</p>

<p>“But how will they know about it?” she sobbed, forgetting
her previous denial.</p>

<p>“Miss Tidmarsh will be called as a witness against
you,” said Mr. Cleaver gravely. “We’ve got to account
for those words of yours somehow, and what is more serious
still—if anything could be more serious—we’ve got to
keep out of sight, if we can, those damning letters of
yours.”</p>

<p>“What letters?” screamed Elsie, a new and unbearable
horror clutching at her.</p>

<p>“The letters, Mrs. Williams, that you have repeatedly
written to Leslie Morrison during the past months.”</p>

<p>“They’re burnt, they’re burnt!” shrieked Elsie. “He
swore he’d burn them!”</p>

<p>“I wish to God he had, but he never did, Mrs. Williams.
Those letters may form the bulk of the evidence against
you. You repeat in them, again and again, that Williams
ill-treated you, made you miserable, and that you wish he
was dead. In one of them occurs the words: ‘He’s ill
now, and taking sleeping draughts. One little mistake in
pouring out the mixture, Leslie, and you and I might be
free! I’d do more than that for our love’s sake, darling.’
Do you understand the awful weight that those
expressions and many, many similar ones would carry with
a jury, Mrs. Williams? We’ve got to put some construction
on them other than the obvious one, if we can’t
get a ruling that they’re inadmissible as evidence, which is
what we shall try for. I want to make it very, very clear
to you. Everything depends on your co-operation. Are
you fit to listen to me?”</p>

<p>Elsie was sobbing and writhing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Have you any letters whatever from Morrison?”
pursued the relentless voice of the solicitor.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What have you done with them?”</p>

<p>“I burnt them all.”</p>

<p>He looked at her as though doubting her words. “Very
few women burn their love-letters, Mrs. Williams.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid to keep them.”</p>

<p>“For fear of your husband seeing them?”</p>

<p>She hesitated. “Partly.”</p>

<p>In Elsie’s mind was a piercing recollection of the haunting
fear that had obsessed her ever since the scene at the house
of Madame Clara, the medium.</p>

<p>“<i>Beware of the written word....</i>”</p>

<p>But she would not give that reason for having destroyed
Morrison’s letters to the solicitor. The strange, undying
remnant of vanity that finds a lurking-place upon the
most apparently trivial and unlikely ground held her back
from the truth.</p>

<p>Elsie Williams realised that Mr. Cleaver was in grimmest
earnest when he told her that only the absolute truth could
possibly save her; she was prepared to tell him the truth
in spite of her deadly terror and shame, but she could not
bring herself to say that the reason why she had destroyed
the letters of Leslie Morrison was because she could never
forget the words spoken by the clairvoyante whom she had
visited.</p>

<p>“I burnt the letters because I had nowhere to keep
them, and I was afraid they might be found,” she repeated,
her young face grey and ravaged.</p>

<p>It was the only particular in which she lied to Mr. Cleaver,
and she did so with blind and irrational persistence.</p>

<p>After the hours that he spent with her, Elsie, physically
exhausted, and psychically strung to a pitch of tension
that she had never known in her life before, was left alone
in her cell, face to face with her own soul.</p>

<p>At first, fragmentary recollections of the past forty-eight
hours obsessed her. She went over and over her conversations
with the police officials, her own replies to Mr.
Cleaver, her mother’s hysterical ejaculations. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
thought of Leslie Morrison, who had backed up her statements
to the police, and who, when both were arrested
together, had only asked through white lips: “Why
her? She was not aware of my movements.”</p>

<p>But since her own half-unconscious betrayal of him,
Elsie’s feeling for Morrison had undergone an extraordinary
revulsion.</p>

<p>It had all turned out so utterly unlike anything that they
had ever planned. It still seemed to Elsie that catastrophe
had fallen, a bolt from the blue, into the midst of their
lives without warning. She still felt that none of it could
be true, that she must wake as from a hideous dream.</p>

<p>When had she had a hideous dream—something about
Horace—something like this?</p>

<p>Dim associations of horror and bewilderment awoke
slowly within her, and brought to her the remembrance of
her visit with Irene Tidmarsh to the woman who had
called herself “clairvoyante.” She had talked in a deep,
rather artificial voice about love and intrigue; she had
bade Elsie beware of the written word. And then all of a
sudden the atmosphere had altered, Madame Clara’s voice
itself had altered, horribly, and she had screamed out
terrifying words and phrases. “Blood, and worse than
blood ... you’re all over blood! O, my God, what’s this?
It’s all over England—<i>you</i>—they’re talking about you.”</p>

<p>Elsie understood. In a flash of searing, anguished
intuition she understood what would happen.</p>

<p>With the appalling rapidity of a vision, there came to
her the realisation of all that would come to pass in the
near future.</p>

<p>She knew already that the police-court trial was the
almost certain preliminary to her committal and Morrison’s
for trial at the Old Bailey. <i>They would be tried for
murder.</i></p>

<p>She and the man who had been her lover would stand in
the dock together as prisoners; lawyers would fight out
questions concerning their past relations; people would
give evidence against them—evidence in their favour;
Elsie would in all probability hear her own letters to Leslie
Morrison read aloud in court....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>It would be a sensational trial, such as she had often
followed with avidity in the newspapers.</p>

<p>“<i>It’s all over England—they’re talking about you....</i>”</p>

<p>But why ... why?...</p>

<p>Elsie Williams’ instant of vision fled from her as suddenly
as it had come, and left her agonisedly and wildly
rebellious, bewildered at the vortex of terror and shame and
misery into which it seemed to her that she had suddenly,
without volition of her own, been flung.</p>

<p>She could not trace the imperceptibly-graduated stages
that had brought her to the pass where catastrophe became
inevitable. To her, it seemed that she had swiftly been
hurled from security into deadly peril by some agency as
irresistible as it was malignant.</p>

<p>Every now and then realisation came to her, when
certain frightful words sprang into frightful meaning, as
they had never done before.</p>

<p>“Murder....”</p>

<p>“Conspiracy ... and incitement to murder....”</p>

<p>“Principal in the second degree....” The police
officials had made use of that expression—so had Mr.
Cleaver.</p>

<p>Elsie’s mother had fetched Mr. Cleaver, and had wildly
repeated, in front of Elsie and the lawyer, that she would
grudge no expense, not if it cost her her last penny.</p>

<p>“And the aunties will help, Elsie, they’ve been ever so
good—anything we can get together, says your Aunt
Gertie, and her face the colour of the tablecloth. Mr.
Cleaver here will tell us the best man, if it—if it comes to—to....”</p>

<p>“You could scarcely do better than Sir Cambourne
Trevor, Mrs. Palmer, but his fee, I ought to warn you, is a
thousand guineas.”</p>

<p>“A thousand guineas!” Elsie and Mrs. Palmer had
screamed together.</p>

<p>And Mr. Cleaver, gaunt and haggard and grey-faced, had
made answer: “It’s her life that will be at stake.”</p>

<p>From time to time, Elsie understood. She knew, at
those moments, what it all meant. There would be no
more concealments, everything would be dragged out into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
a publicity that could only bring with it dishonour and
shameful notoriety, and hatred, and execration.</p>

<p>And she would have to live through it—to suffer through
an ordeal of vast, incredible magnitude, of which the
climax—she knew it in a prescience that mercifully could
not endure—would come in the ghastly dawn of a prison-yard,
beneath the shadow of the scaffold....</p>

<p>Inexorable results would be suffered by herself, and she
would never know how it was that these things had become
inevitable—had happened.</p>

<p class="ph1">(To A. P. D.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A wide</span>, cushioned seat runs round three sides of the deep
fireplace in Torry Delorian’s library for the admitted
reason that Lady Pamela March likes to face the room
when she is talking.</p>

<p>The room, of course, means the audience. Personally,
I consider that she could safely—I mean, without spoiling
her picture of herself—make use of the very word itself.
It is so obviously the only one that applies, when she sits
there, smoking one cigarette after another, and we sit
there, smoking one cigarette after another, all listening to
Pamela, playing up to Pamela, and all more or less sexually
attracted by Pamela.</p>

<p>The subconscious mind of Pamela projects on these
occasions, I think, something of this kind:</p>

<p><b>“<i>The girlish figure dominated the room. Magnetism
vibrated in every gesture of the slim hands, every glance from
the brilliant eyes, every modulation of the rather deep voice.
She held them all, by sheer force of personality. The
peacock-blue folds of her dress, with its girdle of barbaric,
coloured stones....</i>”</b></p>

<p>The bit about the dress, of course, varies. Sometimes
the folds may be saffron-yellow, and the girdle opalescent,
or there is no girdle at all; and anyhow, in those particulars,
the same effect is never repeated twice. But I
imagine that, like all women, she makes a point to herself
of the accoutrements, not realising that the audience—almost
altogether composed of men—attribute the entire
effect to the sheer, smooth slope of her shoulders, the
alluring curves of her mouth, the rich swell of her breasts
beneath semi-transparencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>The impression that inwardly she is projecting really
does reflect itself on to the minds of most people, I believe.</p>

<p>It is only slightly distorted, even in my own version of
it, which runs something like this:</p>

<p><b>“<i>The girlish figure dominated the room. Animal
magnetism vibrated in every gesture</i>”</b> ... and so on—only
leaving out the brilliancy of the eyes and the deepness
of the voice, both of them rather cheap accessories to
a pose that really is quite strong enough without them—to
the end:</p>

<p><b>“<i>She held them all, by sheer will-to-dominate.</i>”</b></p>

<p>Pamela, being a brilliant talker, prefers always to talk
personalities.</p>

<p>Two nights ago, sitting on that cushioned rail that runs
round the fireplace, she recounted an adventure.</p>

<p>“... Only it’s the spiritual adventure that I’m telling
all of you. Because you’ll understand. The other part
was all obvious, the danger and all that. You’ve probably
seen it in the papers.”</p>

<p>She was right. It had been lavishly paragraphed, with
photograph inset. Her <i>flair</i> for publicity is unerring.</p>

<p>“Darlings, how I loathe the Press—if I could only tell
you! But the other part of the affair was so utterly
wonderful, that it’s swamped everything else. It was like
a revelation.</p>

<p>“You know how essentially super-civilised I am? A
man once wrote a poem about my being like a piece of
jade—hard, and brilliant, and polished, and yet with the
unfathomable subtlety and agelessness of the East. My
civilisation is partly temperamental, I suppose, and of
course to a certain extent the result of elaborate education—and
then hereditary as well. Look at Anthony. Could
anyone have a more utterly civilised parent, I ask you?
Elma is less poised, of course, but mercifully for me I’ve
managed to inherit my mother’s physique and my father’s
mentality. Like a sensitised plate, isn’t it? It does mean
isolation of soul, and those terrible nerve-storms of mine,
but in my heart of hearts I know it’s worth it.</p>

<p>“Only people are so ghastly. My friends have to
rescue me.... You remember what it was like, Torry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the night that woman assaulted me at the Embassy, and
talked, and talked, and talked. O Christ! it was all about
food, or flannel, or babies—something too utterly indecent,
I know. I sat there, helpless, martyred—and darling
Torry came and rescued me. I shall never forget it, Torry,
you sweet, never.</p>

<p>“Now this is what happened the other day. (Why do
you allow me to be discursive, dear people?) You know
my car was held up by Sinn Feiners? I, who adore everything
lawless! But it was simply for being Anthony’s
daughter, of course. They hate him so.</p>

<p>“You know how I drive for miles and miles, entirely
alone, just so as to feel the air in my face, and my hands—rather
small, really, by comparison—controlling that
great swift machine. Well, I’d got to such a lonely place
that it was like finding God—when suddenly these men
appeared.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t a bit frightened—I never am frightened—but
it was horrible, all the same. And I kept thinking of
the people who’d be so sorry if I were killed, and wondering
who’d be the sorriest, and who’d remember longest.”</p>

<p><b>(<i>She looked round the room, her dark brows raised in an
expression part whimsical, part pathetic.</i>)</b></p>

<p>“All this isn’t the adventure, you know, though they
took my jewels, and tied me up to a bench on a sort of
heath place. They tied me here, and here.”</p>

<p>She held out a slim ankle, and extended both wrists.</p>

<p>“Dear hearts, don’t, don’t touch me! I’m so dreadfully
on edge to-night. Nothing to do with the adventure,
though. That was altogether beautiful.</p>

<p>“You see there was another woman on the bench, to
whom they’d done exactly the same thing—only she’d
been walking, not driving. They left us together, and said
they’d come back later and shoot us. Terrorism, of course,
but it would be such an ugly way of going out, wouldn’t
it?</p>

<p>“She and I looked at one another, tied to either end of
that bench, and in some way that I simply can’t describe,
our spirits leapt together. She, it turned out afterwards,
recognised me at once—that’s the worst of being too weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
to refuse sittings when one’s pestered by every photographer
in London—but I hadn’t the least idea who she was, and
don’t care. Bright red hair, quite distinguished-looking,
and altogether rather lovely in a pallid, blanc-de-Ninon
way, though no actual physical charm. But I felt it
wouldn’t have mattered if she’d been a <i>déclassée</i>. By the
way, what is a <i>déclassée</i>?</p>

<p>“This still isn’t the adventure—besides, you know this
part already, all of you—but some of those ruffians came
back again, and untied us, and said we could find our own
way home. They’d taken my car, needless to say. I gave
them one of my looks—the sort that means I’m really,
really angry, like when someone kisses me in a clumsy
way, or spills something on my frock—and the men melted,
literally melted, away. Then she and I began to walk,
and this is really when the part that matters started to
happen.</p>

<p>“Having come through this shattering episode, and
found ourselves unshot, and alive, it was almost like two
disembodied spirits communing together. We got into
the realities straight away. It was far more wonderful
than if one of us had been a man, because then sex must
have come into it, but as it was, each of us laid her whole
soul perfectly bare, in the way one can never do to a man,
if he loves one, for fear it should kill his love, or if he
doesn’t love one, for fear it should make him think he does.</p>

<p>“But as it was, each of us was perfectly fearless, and
in a way perfectly shameless. It was partly violent
emotional reaction. You see, we’d both thought we were
facing death.</p>

<p>“She told me that she was utterly miserable. Her
husband was a brute, and her lover had let her down.
He’d fallen in love with a girl, a sort of pure-eyed-baby
person, and had just told this woman—who’d been giving
him everything, of course, for years—that he wanted to <i>se
ranger</i> and get married.</p>

<p>“She was nearly out of her mind, that woman. You
see, she wasn’t young, and then some skin treatment she’d
been having hadn’t succeeded, and was helping to break
her up. She told me about that, too. Oh, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
nothing she didn’t say, but she simply didn’t care, we were
so utterly intimate for that fleeting moment. Nobody
else in the world knew, she told me. She’d always tried
to avoid scandal, and no one had ever really known about
her <i>liaison</i> with this man. (Women <i>are</i> clever about
love.)</p>

<p>“And then I told her every single thing about myself—things
that I’d never dream of breathing in this room,
nor you of believing, most likely. Foul, filthy, hateful
things about myself.... I know now why Catholics go
to confession. It releases so much.</p>

<p>“Darlings, words can’t ever describe what it was like.
I shall never forget it, as long as I live, and neither will she.</p>

<p>“We parted, of course, but we both knew that there
was a link between us that nothing could ever break, even
though we never met again. It was too utterly perfect
and complete as it was.”</p>

<p>There was a silence, and then someone said, suitably:
“Wonderful Pamela!”</p>

<p>She smiled vaguely, shook her head, and then tragically
clasped both hands to her breast. “Please, a cocktail.
I’m so tired. Oh, and what’s the time? I’m dining with
a man at eight, and he’s thrown over a most important
engagement to take me, and he’d be quite capable of
getting angry if I failed him. Sweet, no! Not a quarter
past nine! Oh, please, someone, a car, and take me to
the little tiny, tiny French restaurant in Wardour Street.”</p>

<p>Lady Pamela waved away the cocktail, spilling it,
prayed for another one and drank it, and then wafted away
on the wings of little distressed exclamations and futile,
effective gestures of farewell.</p>

<p>That was two nights ago.</p>

<p>This morning I was in Bond Street, and I saw Pamela
March in her father’s car, held up by a block in the traffic.</p>

<p>On the other side of the narrow street another car with a
solitary woman in it passed slowly. I recognised the
woman instantly from Pamela’s description, for she had
bright red hair, was quite distinguished-looking, and
altogether rather lovely in a pallid, blanc-de-Ninon way,
and radiated a marked degree of physical charm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>The eyes of the two women who had been as disembodied
spirits communing together met in a long look.</p>

<p>And the expression in each pair of eyes was momentarily
identical, and it was with the same effect of immutable
determination that each simultaneously administered and
received the cut direct.</p>

<p><i>They knew....</i></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lambes were very rich.</p>

<p>This was all the nicer for Mrs. Lambe, because once
upon a time, not so very long ago, when she was still Maude
Gunning, she had been poor. From the time she was
eighteen to the time she was thirty, she had taught music
at the girls’ school in Carlorossa Road. She had gone to
and from her work four days a week all through term
time by tram. Fortunately, the tram took her almost
from door to door. She was a bad walker, owing to corns.</p>

<p>During the school holidays Maude had always tried to
find private pupils, and as she and her father and mother
were well known in the big manufacturing town and its
suburbs, and her successes at the L.R.C.M. examinations
were a subject of local pride, she had generally succeeded.</p>

<p>And it was odd to think, as Mrs. Lambe quite often did
think, that most of the large, comfortable, expensive houses
to which she had gone—with a very keen appreciation, on
autumn and winter afternoons, of the big fire blazing in
the pupil’s schoolroom or dining-room, as the case might
be—to think that these houses, for the most part, were
less large, comfortable, and expensive than the one of which
she was now the mistress.</p>

<p>Edgar Lambe, when he first met Miss Maude Gunning
at a tea-party, was already a wealthy man, although not
as rich as the demand for houses that sprang up during
the war afterwards made him.</p>

<p>At the party, Maude played the piano, and played it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
very well. Mr. Lambe, who was naturally musical, asked
to be introduced to her. He had never married,
although he was forty years old, and he had recently
made up his mind to look for a wife. Maude attracted
him, although she was neither pretty nor very
young.</p>

<p>Three months after their first meeting they were married.</p>

<p>Mr. Lambe bought the largest corner house in Victoria
Avenue.</p>

<p>It was, of course, wholly detached from its neighbours.
There was a carriage-sweep in the front, and a long, wide
garden at the back, and a high wall all round. There was
a tennis-court, two greenhouses, and a vegetable garden
beyond the flower-garden.</p>

<p>The inside of Melrose was even more magnificent than
the outside, and far more interesting to Mrs. Lambe, who
was not very fond of being out-of-doors, having had a
great deal too much of it in her tram-journeying days.
But she had many ideas as to comfort and elegance indoors,
and Edgar was generous with money, and had a standard
of his own—and one that secretly rather scared her—as to
the way in which a house should be “run.”</p>

<p>This standard of Edgar’s was principally applied to
lighting, heating, food and service. The house was fitted
with electric light, of course, and Edgar had had a separate
boiler put in for the three bathrooms, so that it was his
favourite boast that if anyone wanted a bath in the middle
of the night, the water would still come out of the tap
almost boiling. There were radiators in all the rooms
except the kitchen, offices and servants’ bedrooms, and
hot pipes in the linen-cupboard.</p>

<p>It took Mrs. Lambe a little while to assimilate Edgar’s
views as to meals. She quite understood that these must
be served punctually, and that the plates must be hot—really
hot—and that there must always be a relay of fresh
toast towards the end of breakfast; and of course late
dinner every night except Sunday, when it was cold supper.
But she did find it a little bit difficult, just at first, to realise
that Edgar disapproved strongly of twice-cooked meat.
At her own home there had been a weekly joint, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
hot on Sunday, cold on Monday, hashed on Tuesday, and
cottage-pie’d on Wednesday—and sometimes, if it had
been a larger joint than usual, curried on Thursday and
turned into rissoles on Friday.</p>

<p>At Melrose, after one, or at the most two, appearances
in the dining-room, the beef disappeared into the kitchen
and was finished there, while a new joint, or a pair of fowls,
took its place on the upstairs <i>menu</i>.</p>

<p>The amount of “butcher’s meat” that came into the
house amazed and disconcerted its mistress, until she
found that her servants took it as a matter of course, and
that her husband continually praised her to his friends as a
good manager, and that the monthly bills—which at first
had appalled her—by no means exceeded the sum which
he had himself suggested that he should allow her for the
housekeeping.</p>

<p>By the time that Mrs. Lambe had a nursery, with two
little girls in it, and a nurse, and a nursery-maid to wait
upon them, she took it quite as a matter of course that
there should be yet a third list of items to consider in the
ordering of meals—weekly chickens, and special dairy
produce, and a regular supply of white fish, for the nursery.
This question of food for the household was, of course,
immensely important, and she gave a great deal of conscientious
thought to it, thankful when the cook suggested
a new variety of sweet for the dinner-parties to which
Edgar so much enjoyed inviting his business friends and
their families.</p>

<p>On these occasions he himself selected the wines with
the utmost care, and instructed the two parlour-maids
minutely and repeatedly in the proper formula to be
employed with each course.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe was always relieved that this great responsibility
did not in any way rest upon her. A mistake, she
felt, would be altogether <i>too</i> terrible.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid and the waitress who always came in
for the evening when the Lambes entertained, never made
mistakes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe was very “good” with servants, and never
had any difficulty in finding and keeping thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
satisfactory domestics. The little girls’ nurse, who received
far higher wages than any of them except the cook, was the
only one with whom there was sometimes a little trouble.</p>

<p>She occasionally hinted that Ena and Evelyn were rather
spoiled, and inclined to come up to the nursery disposed
to be fretful and out of sorts after too much notice in the
drawing-room, and far too many expensive chocolates from
the pink and blue and gilt boxes that were always being
given to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Lambe was a lavish and indulgent father. He
thought his fair-haired, pretty little daughters wonderful,
and took the greatest delight in associating “Dad’s” return
from the office with new toys or “surprises” of sweetmeats.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe never had the heart to disappoint him by
suggesting that his munificence was making the little
girls rather critical and capricious, even at six and four
years old. Edgar only roared with appreciative laughter
when they told him, seriously and rather crossly, that they
always wanted the chocolates to come from Blakiston’s—which
was the best, and by far the most expensive, confectioner’s
in the city. They did not care for any other
kind.</p>

<p>Edgar repeated this story to a great many of his friends,
who were as much amused as he was himself at such an
instance of early discrimination.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe was amused herself, and could not help
thinking that Ena and Evelyn were smart and original
children.</p>

<p>They were also very pretty; rather pallid, sharp-featured
little things, always beautifully dressed, exactly
alike. Neither she nor Edgar regretted in the very least
that neither of them had been a boy.</p>

<p>Every night Maude Lambe, who had been brought up
to be thoroughly religious, knelt at the side of her enormous
bed, with its opulent pink satin duvet, and humbly thanked
God for all that He had given her—Edgar and the children,
and Edgar’s wealth and kindness, and her beautiful, comfortable
home.</p>

<p>There was only one fly in the ointment—Aunt Tessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Edgar had told her all about Aunt Tessie before they
were married. He had explained that she would live with
him always, in spite of the undeniable fact that she was
Not like Other People, and that he would never allow her
to be sent away to an institution, whatever the other
Lambe relations might say.</p>

<p>Aunt Tessie had been very good to him when he was a
little boy, and this Edgar never intended to forget. He
had had a very unhappy childhood, with a mother who
drank and a stepfather who beat him. Aunt Tessie, who
had actually made a living for herself in those days out of
painting pictures, had done everything that she could do
to induce them to let little Edgar come and live with her,
and when they would not agree to that, she had still sent
him presents and surreptitiously given him pocket-money,
and when he had been sent away to school, she had come
regularly and taken him out, and invited him to her flat
whenever she could. She was the only person who had
ever shown him any affection when he was a child, Edgar
had once told his wife.</p>

<p>Maude had been very much touched, and thought it
noble of dear Edgar to remember so faithfully, in his
great prosperity, the good old aunt who had long ceased to
be able to paint even bad pictures, and who had become
terribly, almost dangerously, eccentric about ten years
earlier. Edgar had then immediately taken her to live with
him, declaring Aunt Tessie once and for all to be his charge.</p>

<p>All this he had explained to his wife before they were
married, and her generous and even eager acquiescence had
met him more than half-way.</p>

<p>Maude, indeed, had been ready to accept Aunt Tessie
as her charge, too. She had felt nothing but a tender compassion
for the probably frail, half-childish invalid, towards
whose garrulousness she would never fail of kindly semi-attention,
and to whose bodily weakness every care should
be extended. But Aunt Tessie had turned out not to be
that sort of invalid at all.</p>

<p>To begin with, her physical health was robust and
powerful. She was only fifty-five, and her hair was not
grey, but a strong, virulent auburn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Her complexion was sanguine, her large, harshly-lined
face suffused with colour and disfigured by swelling,
purplish veins.</p>

<p>Her voice was very loud and hoarse, and she laughed
with a sound like a neigh. As for Aunt Tessie’s appetite,
it was simply prodigious. Even had expense been a
serious consideration at Melrose, Mrs. Lambe would never
have grudged anyone a hearty meal—she had too often
gone semi-hungry herself for that—but really, Aunt
Tessie, with her second and third helping of beef, and her
two glasses of claret, and her frank eagerness for dessert
chocolates, was not decent.</p>

<p>She always had her meals in the dining-room, and it was
really on that account that Ena and Evelyn had their
midday dinner upstairs, and only came downstairs when
the starched and mob-capped maids were handing round
coffee. Their mother would have liked them to come to
the dining-room for luncheon, at least on Sundays, but they
both hated Aunt Tessie, and made faces and laughed at
each other when she uttered any of her loud, inconsequent
remarks, or pushed her food into her mouth with her fingers.</p>

<p>Maude, and even Edgar, had tried to persuade Aunt
Tessie that it would be more comfortable for her to have
all her meals in the large upstairs sitting-room that they
had given her, but Aunt Tessie had been first angry and
then hurt. They wanted her out of the way, she said
angrily, they were ashamed of her, and did not like her to
meet their friends.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe could not help thinking that it was rather
ungrateful of Aunt Tessie to say this, after all that had
been done for her. However, they would not vex and
disappoint the poor old lady, and so she continued to
appear downstairs, even when there was a party, and to
embarrass and disconcert everybody by her ineptitudes and
her uncouth manners at the dinner-table.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>

<p>By the time the Armistice was signed, Mr. Lambe had
become richer than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>He entertained his friends even more often to dinner,
and gave them better wine, although it had always been
so good before. He increased Mrs. Lambe’s allowance for
the housekeeping, and frequently gave her presents of
money to be spent upon herself or the little girls. He
would have given Aunt Tessie money too, but she had
grown even queerer in the course of the past year, and
it was only too evident that what had been called her
“eccentricity” was now becoming something much more
serious. For the very first time, there was trouble with
the maids.</p>

<p>They did not like waiting on Miss Lambe. It was no
wonder, either, poor Mrs. Lambe was forced to admit.</p>

<p>Aunt Tessie was untidy, even dirty, and as the housemaid
once pertly remarked, her bedroom only needed
three gold balls over the door. She kept things to eat
upstairs, and scattered crumbs everywhere.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid, speaking for herself and for the housemaid,
declared that it was quite impossible to do the proper
work of the house and to clear up after Miss Lambe as well.</p>

<p>In another moment she would have given notice....
Mrs. Lambe could see it coming.</p>

<p>Hastily she sent for Emma, the little between-maid, and
informed her that in future she would have the sole care
of Miss Lambe’s bedroom and her sitting-room, and would
wait upon her, instead of the housemaid. She at the same
time raised Emma’s wages by two pounds a year, for she
always tried to be very just.</p>

<p>Emma was only seventeen, and a very childish little
thing, and Mrs. Lambe had not expected her to raise any
objection to the new scheme; but it was surprising,
although satisfactory, to find that Emma seemed to be
actually pleased by it.</p>

<p>She said “Yes’m,” a good many times, and smiled at
her mistress as though joyfully accepting a form of promotion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe was relieved, the parlour-maid and the
housemaid did not give notice, and even Aunt Tessie—very
difficult to please nowadays—appeared contented and
satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>But she was getting worse all the time.</p>

<p>It became more and more embarrassing when visitors
came to Melrose.</p>

<p>The old lady always found out when anyone was expected,
and the more people were coming the noisier and
more excited she became.</p>

<p>One dreadful Sunday there were guests for luncheon—two
of Edgar’s important clients, and little Ena’s godfather—a
rich old bachelor cousin—and two unmarried
ladies, friends of Mrs. Lambe’s maiden days. She was
always very faithful to her friends.</p>

<p>Aunt Tessie actually pranced downstairs and met some
of these people in the hall as they arrived, and greeted
them boisterously, and so incoherently that really they
might almost have been excused for thinking that she had
been taking too much to drink.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe, hastening downstairs from her own room,
could hear it all, although she could not see it, and it was
thus that she afterwards described it to Edgar.</p>

<p>“So glad—so glad to see you!” shouted Aunt Tessie.
“This fine house—always open, and my nephew is so
generous and hospitable. They take advantage, sometimes—there
are bad people about, very bad people.
Sometimes they make attempts ... one’s life isn’t as
safe as it looks, I can assure you....”</p>

<p>She had thrown out such ridiculous and yet sinister
hints once or twice lately. But what <i>could</i> the poor guests
think of it all?</p>

<p>They were very polite, and soon saw that the best thing
to do was to ignore Aunt Tessie as far as possible, and
pretend not to hear when she talked, and not to see when
she shuffled about the room, upsetting ornaments here
and there, and every now and then whisking round suddenly
to look behind her as though she expected someone or
something to be following her. Once she shouted very
loud, “Get out, I tell you! I can <i>smell</i> the poison from
here!...” But after the first involuntary, startled
silence, everyone began simultaneously to talk again, and
very soon after that, luncheon was announced.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe saw that her husband, talking to his principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
guest and smiling a great deal, kept on all the time
turning an anxious eye towards Aunt Tessie, and this
emboldened her to do what she had never done before.</p>

<p>She put her hand on the old lady’s arm, and detained
her whilst the others were all going into the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Dear auntie,” she said, speaking low and very gently,
“I’m sure you’re not well. You look so flushed and tired.
All these people are really too much for you. Do let
Emma carry your lunch upstairs on a tray and have it
comfortably in your own room.”</p>

<p>But it was of no use.</p>

<p>Aunt Tessie, her looks and her manner stranger than
ever, vociferated an incoherent refusal, mixed up with something
about Emma, to whom she had taken a violent fancy.</p>

<p>“A good girl—the only one you can trust. She never
<i>plots against people</i>!” Aunt Tessie shouted, nodding her
head with wild emphasis, and rolling her eyeballs round in
their sockets.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe could do nothing. She dared not let Aunt
Tessie sit next to any of the visitors, and of course she
herself had to have one of the important clients upon either
side of her, but she made Ena and Evelyn, who were
lunching downstairs in honour of the godfather’s presence,
take their places one on each side of their extraordinary
old relative.</p>

<p>Evelyn, who was very little, began to whine and protest,
but Mrs. Lambe pretended not to hear. She knew that
Evelyn’s attention was always very easily distracted. She
felt much more afraid of Ena, and her heart sank when,
out of the corner of her eye, she saw Aunt Tessie officiously
trying to put Ena’s long curls away from her shoulders.</p>

<p>The little girl’s fair, pretty face turned black with
scowls in an instant, and she twitched herself away from
the big, heavy, mottled hand fumbling clumsily at her
neck, and sat with her back as nearly as possible turned to
Aunt Tessie.</p>

<p>One couldn’t really blame the poor children for disliking
her so much, but it was very bad for them ... it made
them naughty and ill-mannered....</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Lambe could only give half her attention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
her guests, and she saw that Edgar, too, underneath his
geniality and his urgent and repeated invitations that
everyone should have more food and more wine, was
anxious and ill at ease.</p>

<p>Every now and then Aunt Tessie’s strident tones rose
above all the other sounds in the big, hot dining-room.</p>

<p>“Not any more—no. They put things into one’s
food sometimes, and then they think one doesn’t notice.
But the one who waits on me—Emma, her name is—she’s
all right. You can trust her.”</p>

<p>Aunt Tessie’s words, no less than her emphasis on Emma’s
trustworthiness, would of course be noticed, and bitterly
resented, by the other two servants, waiting deftly and
quietly at the table. But neither of them moved a muscle,
even when she went on to something worse.</p>

<p>“Never put any confidence in upper servants,” declared
Aunt Tessie, leaning across the table and almost shouting.
“They may be civil enough, but they plot and plan behind
people’s backs. There’s cases in the newspapers very
often ... it’s ... it’s murder, really, you know. They
call it accidental, but sometimes it’s poisoning. One can’t
be too auspicious—suspicious, I should say.”</p>

<p>She paused to laugh vacantly at her own slip of the
tongue, and to let her eyes rove all over the table as
though in search of something.</p>

<p>Mr. Lambe clumsily wrenched at the conversation:
“Talking about newspaper reports, that was a curious
case in Staffordshire....”</p>

<p>The visitors seconded him gamely, and Aunt Tessie’s
voice was overborne and heard again only in snatches.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe, however, was very much upset, and she
ordered coffee to be brought to the drawing-room so as to
make a move as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Things were a little better in the drawing-room. Ena and
Evelyn were soon screaming and romping round Ena’s
godfather, and one of Maude’s humble friends, perhaps
feeling that she owed her something in return for the
splendid luncheon and lavish hospitality, sat in the bow-window
with Aunt Tessie and kept her away from the rest
of the room. This was a great relief, although it led to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
uncomfortable moment when the party was breaking up,
and Aunt Tessie, vehemently taking leave of her kind
companion, actually caught up a little gilt trifle from
Maude’s knick-knack shelf and tried to press it upon her
acceptance.</p>

<p>Miss Mason was very tactful, pretending with rather an
embarrassed look to accept the impossible gift, and secretly
slipping it on to a table near the door as she went out.</p>

<p>Aunt Tessie did not see, but Maude did. She was nearly
crying by the time it was all over and everyone had gone
away. The children had been sent upstairs again, and
Aunt Tessie’s heavy footsteps had taken her to her own
part of the house.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, she and Edgar hardly spoke to one
another about the disastrous subject, but Maude Lambe
knew very well that he now, as well as she, fully realised
the discomfort and humiliation entailed upon the whole
household by his too-generous treatment of Aunt Tessie.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>

<p>Soon it was no longer possible to pretend that Aunt Tessie
was not getting worse and worse. Her constant, irrelevant
allusions to plots, and poisonings, and wicked people, had
become a fixed delusion.</p>

<p>She really thought that everyone at Melrose was conspiring
against her life, and she would allow no one, except
Emma, to do anything for her.</p>

<p>It was a mercy, Mrs. Lambe often told herself, that
Emma was such a good little thing. She was so willing,
and never seemed to grudge the time and trouble that she
was obliged to spend over cleaning Aunt Tessie’s apartments
and tidying up after her. She would even listen,
respectfully and yet compassionately, to Aunt Tessie’s long,
rambling denunciations and accusations.</p>

<p>“Poor old lady!” Maude once overheard Emma saying
to another servant. “She’s a lady just the same, for all
she’s gone queer, and I behaves towards her like I would
to any other lady, that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Funny kind of a lady that makes a face at a servant,
as she did at me this morning.”</p>

<p>“She never done that to me, nor nothing the least like
it,” said Emma stoutly.</p>

<p>It was only too true that Aunt Tessie was very rude to
all the maids except Emma, and sometimes to Edgar and
Maude as well. As she grew worse, she seemed to forget
all their kindness and generosity, and to look upon them
as being her enemies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambe would not let the little girls go near her
any more, and the nurse had orders to keep them away
from Miss Lambe “until she grew better.”</p>

<p>Aunt Tessie, however, did not grow better.</p>

<p>The doctor, an old friend of Edgar Lambe’s, advised
them to have a nurse for her, if they were still determined
to keep her on at Melrose, instead of sending her to one of
the many excellent establishments that he could have
recommended.</p>

<p>“Nothing in the least like an institution or—or asylum.
Simply a nursing home where Miss Lambe would have
entire freedom and every possible comfort, but would yet
receive the constant medical supervision that her unfortunate
condition renders necessary.”</p>

<p>But Edgar Lambe remained obstinate. Aunt Tessie
had been very good to him in the past, and he had always
said that she should be his special charge. He would not
send her away to any nursing home, however highly
recommended.</p>

<p>He was, however, quite willing that a professional nurse
should be installed at Melrose. The expense, he said, was
nothing, if it would make things easier for Maude and be
of advantage to Aunt Tessie.</p>

<p>The presence of Nurse Alberta certainly fulfilled both
these requirements.</p>

<p>She was an intelligent, pleasant-looking woman of five-
or six-and-thirty, with none of the pretensions so often
associated with her class. She had meals with Aunt
Tessie, in the latter’s big, comfortable sitting-room, and
slept in a little room adjoining hers. Both of them were
waited upon by Emma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>Aunt Tessie nowadays made no difficulty about not
coming to the dining-room. Her crazy old mind had
fastened upon the idea of poison, and Emma and Nurse
Alberta were the only people from whom she would accept
food or drink.</p>

<p>The nurse told Emma, with whom she became quite
friendly by dint of constant association, that the “persecution
mania” was a very common symptom amongst those
who were mentally deranged.</p>

<p>“They always think that everybody’s against them,” she
declared cheerfully, “even those who do most for them.
Look at this poor old lady, for instance! She thinks Mr.
and Mrs. Lambe are plotting against her, and I’m sure
they’re goodness itself to her, and have been for years, I
should think. No expense grudged, and everything done
to make her comfortable. Why, most people would have
had an own mother sent away by this time and put under
restraint—and Miss Lambe is only an aunt. No real
relation at all, as you may say, to Mrs. Lambe. Really, I
do think Mrs. Lambe’s behaved wonderfully, and I’m sure
she finds it a strain.”</p>

<p>Nurse Alberta was quite right. Mrs. Lambe did find
the presence of Aunt Tessie in the house a great strain,
even now.</p>

<p>In her heart, she was terribly afraid that the old aunt,
who had so rapidly passed from one distressing stage to
another, might suddenly become a real danger to those
around her.</p>

<p>She thought of Ena and Evelyn and shuddered. Very
often, she woke in the night and crept out to the landing,
trembling, to listen at the night-nursery door.</p>

<p>One day, when Nurse Alberta had been in the house for
some time, Mrs. Lambe felt so wretched and so much unstrung
by her state of now chronic nervousness, that she
detained the doctor after his habitual visit to Aunt Tessie,
and timidly spoke to him of her own symptoms.</p>

<p>He listened very attentively, asked her several questions,
and finally made a suggestion which Mrs. Lambe saw at
once ought to have occurred to her earlier.</p>

<p>She was going to have another child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>It was over five years since Evelyn’s birth, and she had
somehow never expected to have any more babies, but both
Mr. and Mrs. Lambe were honestly pleased.</p>

<p>They hoped for a son.</p>

<p>It was this discovery that led to the modification of
Edgar Lambe’s views about Aunt Tessie. Obviously, the
presence of the unfortunate old lady subjected Maude to a
continual strain that might easily become more and more
severe as time went on.</p>

<p>The doctor, privately consulted by Mr. Lambe, admitted
that in his opinion it was not quite fair on Mrs. Lambe, in
her condition, to keep the aggressive, turbulent invalid in
the house with her. And it wasn’t as if Aunt Tessie herself
really benefited by it, either. She was far past appreciating
any kindness or attention shown to her now. Her
<i>idée fixe</i> was that everyone at Melrose excepting poor little
Emma, the maid, was plotting against her in some way,
and seeking to poison her.</p>

<p>Mr. Lambe listened, nodding his head, his red, heavy-jowled
face puckered with distress. It went against the
grain with him to invalidate the boast of years—that
Aunt Tessie should always share his home—and yet in his
heart he felt that the doctor was right.</p>

<p>Aunt Tessie was past minding or knowing, poor soul—and
Maude and their unborn son must come first.</p>

<p>When once he had fairly made up his mind to it, Edgar
Lambe could not help feeling a certain relief. He, too, in
his own way, had suffered on those dreadful occasions
when Aunt Tessie had insisted upon appearing downstairs,
and had made his friends and his family uncomfortable by
her strange, noisy eccentricity. Even nowadays his daily
visit to her room was a miserable affair. It gave her no
pleasure now to see the nephew for whom she had once
done so much, and who had done so much for her in return.
She classed him with her imaginary enemies.</p>

<p>It was very difficult for Edgar Lambe, who was not at
all an imaginative man, not to feel irrationally wounded
by those wild accusations of enmity. He could scarcely
be brought to understand that poor Aunt Tessie’s floods of
foolish vituperation had, in themselves, no meaning at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“But she was always devoted to me,” he said, half
resentfully and half piteously. “I can’t make it out at all.
You’d think that even now she’d be able to—to distinguish
a bit between me and the wretched cook or charwoman.
But no, she abuses us all alike, and seems to think we’re
all in league to do her in.”</p>

<p>“It’s part of her illness, Mr. Lambe,” said Nurse Alberta
soothingly. “You know, she really is quite cracky, poor
old lady.”</p>

<p>The “arrangements,” as the doctor called them, were
made as speedily as possible, since they were naturally
distressing to everybody, and Mr. and Mrs. Lambe went
themselves to see Aunt Tessie’s new quarters, and to talk
to the charming lady at the head of the establishment, and
get special permission for Nurse Alberta, to whom Aunt
Tessie was used, to take her there and remain with her for
some time until she grew accustomed to it all.</p>

<p>“Fires in her room, of course, and any extras that she
may fancy,” said Mr. Lambe impressively. “Expense is
of no consideration at all. I shall send round a comfortable
couch for the sitting-room this afternoon.”</p>

<p>He did so, and Mrs. Lambe added two or three fat
cushions, and a decorated lampshade and waste-paper
basket, such as she liked in her own drawing-room.</p>

<p>When Aunt Tessie was told that she was going away
from Melrose for a time, she was delighted.</p>

<p>“Then I can relish my food again,” she said rather coarsely.</p>

<p>“There’s never any knowing what they’re all up to here.”</p>

<p>That remained her attitude up to the very last. She
dumped them all together as objects of her aggrieved
resentment. Edgar, Maude, the two little girls, the impassive,
well-behaved servants.</p>

<p>But when she said good-bye to Emma the night before
she was to go away, Aunt Tessie squeezed her hand hard,
and gave her some money and several ornaments and
little trinkets from her own possessions.</p>

<p>Soft-hearted Emma cried, and hurried away to the
sitting-room to find Nurse Alberta. “I just can’t bear to
listen to her, poor old lady, saying I’m the only one as
never tried to do her a mischief,” she sobbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“You’re a silly girl to take on so,” said the nurse good-naturedly.
“Why, she’ll be ever so well looked after where
she’s going, and there’s good money being spent on her
comforts, I can tell you, and Mr. Lambe won’t let that be
wasted. It isn’t like some poor looneys, that get put away
and not a soul of their own people ever goes near them to
see how they’re getting on. She’ll be kept an eye on,
you may be very sure, and it’ll be best for all parties to
have her under another roof, really it will.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know!” said Emma.</p>

<p>“It isn’t even as if she wanted to stay, you know,
Emma. She’s turned dead against them, like cases of her
sort often do. Look at the way she spoke to you about
your being the only one that didn’t want to poison her, or
some such rubbish.”</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“Nurse,” said Emma suddenly, “do mad people <i>know</i>
as they’re mad?”</p>

<p>“They say not,” indifferently returned Nurse Alberta,
biting a thread off her piece of needlework. “Why,
Emma?”</p>

<p>“Because—well, me and Cook got to talking last night
about poor Miss Lambe, and—I can’t say it how I mean,”
Emma rambled on confusedly, “but Cook would have it
that people as go off their heads—well, they <i>are</i> off their
heads. They don’t look at anything like we do any more—it’s
sort of all upside down to them. But I didn’t think
it was like that—well, at any rate not with Miss Lambe.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Nurse Alberta.</p>

<p>She looked interested and Emma was encouraged.</p>

<p>“I thought, perhaps,” she said timidly, “that the inside
of her poor mind is still like everybody’s else’s, in a way,
only she can’t get the thoughts to come out right. And I
thought, perhaps, that when she said all that about them
wanting to poison her, it was only her—her mad sort of
way of saying that she’d felt, all along, they really wanted
her to go away. And that would be why she said I was
the only person that she was safe with. Because I never
did want her to go away. The master and mistress and
the young ladies may have felt like that. Of course, it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
been ever so trying for them, I know, having her here like
that—and the girls downstairs, they wanted her to go.
But I never did, and I wondered if perhaps that was what
she sort of felt, only she couldn’t explain it right, and so
it came out that way—in all her talk about being poisoned,
and that.”</p>

<p>Emma stopped and looked rather wistfully at the nurse.</p>

<p>“You’ll think I’m balmy myself, talking like that. And
I can’t explain what I mean a bit well. It’s not as if I’d
been educated like you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Nurse Alberta, smiling. “I
think I understand what you mean, Emma. According to
your notion, the poor old lady feels and thinks pretty much
the same as we do, but she’s lost the trick of communicating
her feelings and her thoughts. They—they get lost in
transmission, so to say.”</p>

<p>“You do put it well, Nurse!” said Emma admiringly.</p>

<p>Nurse Alberta looked gratified. “I don’t know,” she
said modestly. But she was herself rather pleased by the
sound of the phrase that she had used, and could not
resist repeating it.</p>

<p>“It’s a bit far-fetched, perhaps, but there’s certainly
something in what you say, Emma,” she observed, biting
off another thread. “Lost in transmission—that’s the idea—lost
in transmission!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">I</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">You</span> funny little thing!” he said patronisingly.</p>

<p>Adela resented the term violently, but because he was
the only man who had ever attempted to talk personalities
with her, she accepted it smilingly.</p>

<p>“I must read some of those books of yours. Tell me
what the names are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter! Never mind about my books,”
she said hurriedly.</p>

<p>Adela could not imagine Willoughby reading anybody’s
books, unless definitely of that class which deals with a
fictitious Secret Service or the intrigues of an imaginary
kingdom.</p>

<p>Her own books were small masterpieces of psychology,
subtly ironical. A shudder, half-humorous, half-despairing,
came over her at the idea of Hal Willoughby, bored
and mystified, ploughing his way through one of her books.</p>

<p>“Never mind about my books,” she repeated. “I’d
rather you thought of me as a girl than as a writer.”</p>

<p>She felt wildly daring in so speaking, partly because she
had called herself a girl, although she was thirty, and
partly because it was the first time that she had ever
attempted what she supposed to be a flirtation.</p>

<p>Her reputation for cleverness had always been so great
and so terrible that young men had never dared to approach
her.</p>

<p>She supposed that must be the reason for their aloofness,
since she had always been passably pretty; and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
now, by artificial light, she looked five years younger
than she was.</p>

<p>Her hair and her colouring were charming in a subdued
and unvivid way, her features straight and very clean-cut.
She hardly realised how much too thin were the lips of
her tiny mouth, how intense and over-prominent her large
hazel eyes.</p>

<p>“I never can imagine how anybody can write a book,”
said Willoughby.</p>

<p>Adela moved uneasily. She could tell what was coming.</p>

<p>“Do you think of a plot first, or do you just make it
up as you go along?”</p>

<p>“It all depends.”</p>

<p>She made the meaningless reply that had so often served
her before.</p>

<p>“I should never know what to make the people say
next. Aren’t conversations awfully difficult?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are always on the look-out for people
to put into your books—under invented names, of course.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I expect you are! I expect really you sit
there, taking it all in, you know.”</p>

<p>Why did people always think it necessary to talk to
her like this?</p>

<p>“You ought to write a play. They say it pays like
fun.”</p>

<p>“But, you see, I’m not a dramatist.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rubbish! If you’re clever enough to write books,
of course you could write a play. I should, if I were you—really
I should.” His voice was charged with encouragement.</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t. Don’t let’s talk about that.”</p>

<p>“Why not? I want to hear about these books of yours.
I’ve never met a literary lady before.”</p>

<p>It was of no use. He would not talk to her as she was
almost sure that he would have talked to any other woman
in the room, given those distant sounds of music from the
ballroom, that hazy moonlight above the bench beneath
the syringa-bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>Adela grimly sacrificed her art, perjuring her soul away.
“I expect you think it’s very funny of me to write books,”
she said, desperately adapting her vocabulary to his own.
“I really do it mostly—a good deal—because it brings in
money.” She tried to laugh, and hated herself for the
artificiality of the sound.</p>

<p>“I suppose girls are always glad of extra pocket-money,”
he assented indifferently.</p>

<p>A girl—that was how he thought of her.</p>

<p>She was pleased at that, but she struggled for a more
serious recognition of her capabilities, too. “It’s not only
pocket-money. I can really get a living from my writing,
though I’m always at home with my mother. But I
could be independent to-morrow if I liked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now!” The words might have expressed
remonstrance, incredulity, astonishment.</p>

<p>“The advance royalty—that’s the money the publishers
give me in advance—on my last book was two hundred
pounds,” she said calmly.</p>

<p>She had never gone away to work, never had to pay for
her food or for a roof over her head, never tried her strength
or the strength of her resources in the struggle for livelihood
amongst unsupported women.</p>

<p>Two hundred pounds for her year’s work was a large sum,
with no calls upon it.</p>

<p>Willoughby repeated after her: “Two hundred pounds!
I say! You don’t expect me to believe you get that just
for writing a story?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She was uncertain of the reason for his disbelief,
and even whether he really did disbelieve her.</p>

<p>“But was it a serious book, or just a novel?” He really
sounded perplexed.</p>

<p>“Oh, ‘just a novel’!” she said bitterly.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! How many do you write in a year?”</p>

<p>“That last one took me over a year. My first one I
worked at, on and off, for five years.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it doesn’t matter to you, taking your time,
but it would be quite worth scribbling them off one after
the other, if you can get money like that without working
for it, so to speak,” said Hal Willoughby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>He fingered his thick, fair moustache, and Adela looked
up at him furtively in the moonlight.</p>

<p>He was very big and good-looking; and when she
danced with him, and met his full, bold gaze, Adela could
almost forget about such conversations between them as
the present one.</p>

<p>Besides, he had not always talked like this. Once he
had pretended not to know what colour her eyes were,
and once he had told her about his life in India. She
wished intensely that the conversation now would shift
to some such topic.</p>

<p>The moonlight and the heavy scent of the syringa seemed
to mock her.</p>

<p>“And what are your books about?” said Willoughby
laboriously. “Love, I suppose?” He broke into a roar
of laughter. “Does the heroine fall fainting into the
hero’s arms in the last chapter, eh? That’s the style,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Adela stood up, trembling. “I think I want to go in
now, please. The—the dance must be finished now.”</p>

<p>He stood up also. “But I say! What’s the matter?
You’re not ratty, are you?” He pulled unceremoniously
at the prim velvet ribbons that hung from her waist. “Sit
down again. Don’t you know I’m going away to-morrow?
You might be a little bit nice to me, I do think.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you wanted me to be,” she said swiftly.</p>

<p>He laughed, and pulled her on to the bench again.</p>

<p>Adela’s mother, with whom she always lived, had told
her very often that men never really respected a woman
who let them “take liberties.” Adela, never before put
to the test, recklessly determined to disregard the parental
axiom.</p>

<p>When Willoughby caught hold of her chilly little ringless
hand, she made no movement of withdrawal.</p>

<p>He looked down at her and laughed again. “What an
odd little thing you are! I don’t believe you’ve ever been
kissed, have you?”</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>“Has anybody ever made love to you, now?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said defiantly and untruly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>He laughed quite openly, and declared, “I don’t believe
it!”</p>

<p>Still laughing, he put his hand under her chin, tilting
up her face, and kissed her.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>

<p>Hal Willoughby’s careless parting kiss remained the
only one that Adela was destined to receive.</p>

<p>For ten years more she lived with her mother, and
heard her say proudly to other mothers, coming with the
news of Mollie’s engagement, or Dolly’s beautiful new baby:</p>

<p>“Ah, I still keep my Adela, I’m glad to say. She’s
almost too fastidious, I sometimes think. She’s never
made herself cheap with anyone. And then there’s her
writing, too.”</p>

<p>Adela had slowly been making a name for herself, but
her great success only came after her mother’s death. A
long novel, at which she had been working for several years,
made her reputation in the world of letters.</p>

<p>She had inherited money from her mother, and her
books brought her in more.</p>

<p>Adela was able to indulge in artistic necessities.</p>

<p>It became imperative that she should retire, whenever
she wanted to write, to a Yorkshire moor with an atmosphere
of ruggedness and strength, and very few trees.</p>

<p>So many journalists, so many fellow-writers, such a
number of the new-born coterie that “followed the Adela
Alston method” had inquired so earnestly in what peculiar
setting Adela found it necessary to enshrine her inspiration,
that the need of the Yorkshire moor had suddenly sprung,
full-grown, into being.</p>

<p>She built a two-roomed cottage, engaged a caretaker, and
wrote in a small summer-house, wearing knickerbockers and
sandals, and smoking violently. This was in the summer.
In the winter, inspiration was obliged to content itself
with Hampstead, and Adela had to wear shoes and stockings
and a skirt.</p>

<p>At forty she had gained greatly in assurance, and knew
herself for the leading spirit in a small group of intensely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
modern women writers, by whom she was devoutly worshipped.</p>

<p>Adela became accustomed to being the person who was
listened to, in the society of her fellows.</p>

<p>They were not only interested in her work, but deeply,
intensely interested in herself.</p>

<p>“You know almost too much of human nature, Adela.
It’s not decent.”</p>

<p>Adela enjoyed being told that.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen all sorts in my time,” she said musingly.</p>

<p>It would no longer have pleased her to be thought younger
than she was. On the contrary, she was apt to emphasise
in herself the aspect of a full maturity.</p>

<p>“That last study of yours is simply magnificent. Dear,
I don’t wonder you’ve never chosen to marry. No man’s
vanity could survive your insight.”</p>

<p>A newcomer to the group leant forward eagerly. Her
characteristic was lack of self-restraint, which she acclaimed
in herself as fearlessness.</p>

<p>“But you’ve known the great realities—you’ve known
passion,” she urged foolishly. “You could never write
as you do, otherwise.”</p>

<p>Adela gazed at her new disciple from under drooping
eyelids. “I am not ashamed of it,” she said quietly.
“I am proud of it.”</p>

<p>The girl nodded with grotesque, unconscious vehemence.</p>

<p>The two other women-friends of Adela who were present,
exchanged a meaning look with one another. Each had
heard Adela’s story before, had shown loyal pride and
understanding. There was no need of further demonstration
from them. Adela was looking at the girl.</p>

<p>“There was one man in my life,” she said low and
deeply. “There is never more than one—that counts.
And a woman who has never loved, never been loved,
never met her mate—has never lived.”</p>

<p>The room was tensely silent.</p>

<p>“It was more than ten years ago, and I have outlived
the poignancy of it. I have never seen him since—I
never shall. But I make no secret of having known
fulfilment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>Her voice was low and rich with intense enjoyment of
her own effect.</p>

<p>“Even now, though, when all the storm and stress is
long, long past—it’s odd, but the scent of a syringa in
bloom can still hurt me. You see—I was swept right off
my feet.”</p>

<p>She paused before concluding with the words that she
had unconsciously learnt by heart, so significantly did they
always round off her retrospect.</p>

<p>“I had waited for him all my life. He asked everything,
and I gave—everything.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“You splendid woman!”</p>

<p>Adela leant back again, her large eyes gazing abstractedly
into the past, full of a brooding satisfaction. Her lips
exhaled a sound that was barely audible.</p>

<p>“Hal Willoughby!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GALLANT LITTLE LADY</h2>
</div>

<h3 class="nobreak">I</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I hope</span> you are using all your influence to prevent the
marriage?” said Clyde, in the impersonal tone that he
always adopted when speaking to his wife of her only
daughter.</p>

<p>“Why, Charles? They’re madly in love.”</p>

<p>“That is why,” said Sir Charles.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Lady Clyde had not the slightest desire to know what
her husband meant, and had already made up her mind that
she disagreed with it root and branch, so she said, “What
do you mean?” in a tone of indignation, and not one of
enquiry, and gave him no time to answer.</p>

<p>“Richard is a gentleman, he’s earning a very good
salary, and he adores Rita. The only possible objection
is their having to live in the East, but everyone says the
Malay States are quite healthy, and she’s very strong,
thank heaven. If she’s plucky enough to face it, I don’t see
how <i>we</i> can object.”</p>

<p>“My objection has nothing to do with their living in
the Malay States. It is simply concerned with the fact
that they will have nothing whatever to depend upon
except Richard Lambourne’s salary. He is a young man,
he has saved nothing, and he has no expectations from
anybody.”</p>

<p>“Rita has her own small income.”</p>

<p>“It might keep them from starvation, certainly, but it
wouldn’t be enough for a family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“No one expects it to be. Richard will save if he has a
wife, naturally, and he hopes to become a part owner of the
rubber estate, later on. After all, it’s very creditable for a
man of his age to have been made general manager already.”</p>

<p>“Very.”</p>

<p>“Then what have you against him?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” said Sir Charles mildly.</p>

<p>“A minute ago you were telling me how you hoped I
should use my influence to prevent this marriage. If you
have nothing against him, why shouldn’t they marry?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have ‘something against’ Rita, as you
express it.”</p>

<p>“Rita is only your step-daughter, Charles, and I know
very well that your own children——”</p>

<p>“<i>Our</i> own children——”</p>

<p>“That they come first, and always have. But I have
an unprejudiced eye,” said Lady Clyde warmly, “and I
don’t pretend that Rita isn’t a greater deal cleverer, prettier,
and more attractive than all the others put together. And
as for talking of having anything against her, it’s the
sheerest nonsense, as even you must know.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles looked at his wife with an expression which
she had long ago summed up, not inaptly, as “Charles
looking as though he couldn’t decide if one were worth
explaining the alphabet to or not.” On this occasion,
Sir Charles appeared to decide in favour of the modicum
of intelligence required.</p>

<p>“My case is simply this, Catherine. If Richard
Lambourne and Rita marry now, they are entirely dependent
upon Richard’s job. Say he loses it, or loses his health—which
amounts to the same thing—or falls off his horse
and breaks his neck, Rita may be left with a child, or
children, and nothing whatever to live on except a yearly
sum which she has hitherto spent upon her clothes, largely
supplemented by presents from you.”</p>

<p>“As though Rita wouldn’t always have a welcome from
me, and as though I wouldn’t share my last crust with her!”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I should expect you to divide your
last crust into equal parts between Rita and your four other
children,” said Sir Charles with coldness. “But apart from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
last crusts, which is a rhetorical way of speaking, you had
better understand once and for all, my dear Catherine, that
my sons and daughter are not to be sacrificed to Rita. If
she marries this man, he must keep her. This house is her
home, and has been so for twenty years or so, but once she
is married, it ceases to be her home. I am sorry if I hurt
your feelings, but if Rita is to take the risk of marriage with
a man who has nothing to depend on but what he can earn
for himself, she had better understand exactly what she is
doing. Personally, I consider her entirely unfitted to take
such a risk.”</p>

<p>“She is more than ready to take any risk. You are
perfectly incapable of understanding Rita, Charles, and what
a generous, ardent nature she has. And she is very, very
much in love, for the first time in her life. You know as
well as I do that plenty of people have wanted to marry
Rita, and I think it’s wonderful that she should have
refused so many offers, to give herself to a man who isn’t
rich, simply because she loves him.”</p>

<p>“You look upon it as being decided, then?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do. She is absolutely determined to
marry him and go out with him at once. I can’t refuse my
consent—and I shan’t—and they’re not dependent upon
yours, Charles.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a rather nervous defiance, but
Sir Charles said with great calm:</p>

<p>“Certainly they’re not. I shall therefore consider the
subject closed, so far as my objections go.”</p>

<p>He kept his word, as he invariably did.</p>

<p>The wedding of Rita and Richard took place six weeks
later.</p>

<p>Rita was little and very pretty, with big dark eyes,
a pathetic baby face, and, in rather quaint contrast, a very
erect little figure and a decided bearing.</p>

<p>Unlike her stepfather, the majority of her friends and
relations fully realised the beautiful recklessness of Rita’s
love-match.</p>

<p>“A very gallant little lady!” said an old friend of Lady
Clyde’s, and she reversed an opinion which she had hitherto
held as to his senility. He used the same phrase, which
had evidently caught his ancient fancy, when the bride was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
making her farewells, and it oddly suited her appearance,
in a velvet dress and a three-cornered hat with a long plume,
vaguely recalling pictures of cavalier heroines.</p>

<p>“So she’s marrying all for love, and going eight thousand
miles away from home!” said Rita’s aged admirer. “None
of your mercenary, modern, ideas there. A gallant little
lady, I call her.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>

<p>The same phrase was repeated, and by many people, when
Rita and Richard Lambourne came home again, three years
later. The great rubber slump had come, and Richard had
lost his job. He said that he hoped to find something to
do in England.</p>

<p>“Professional men of all classes are hoping exactly
the same thing at the present moment, all over the country,”
said Sir Charles Clyde.</p>

<p>The Lambournes stayed with the Clydes for a little while,
then they and their baby and their nurse moved into a tiny
house on the outskirts of a large neighbouring town, and
then it was that such a number of people took to making
use of the apt descriptive phrase first employed when Rita
married.</p>

<p>Many of them had known her in her girlhood, the spoilt
and favoured child of Lady Clyde, at home in her stepfather’s
house.</p>

<p>They could fully appreciate the contrast with her present
position.</p>

<p>Richard could not find any work, although he answered
advertisements and wrote to influential friends. He was
not a strong man, and very soon showed signs of great
discouragement and anxiety.</p>

<p>Rita, on the contrary, was always cheerful, and discussed
the situation very frankly, laughing merrily at her own
struggle with unaccustomed privations.</p>

<p>“It’s so lucky I’ve got a little money that my own father
left me. By managing very, very carefully, we’re living
on that. Poor Richard hadn’t a penny beyond his salary,
and now of course that’s all gone—poor darling!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>She was drolly confidential with her numerous friends.</p>

<p>“It’s so funny to have to think before I take a second
helping of pudding, even, and yet I suppose I really ought
to. But I don’t think I’ve got a very large appetite, have
I, Richard?”</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t.”</p>

<p>“What a good thing!” She laughed as she spoke,
but Richard remained unsmiling and miserable, and gradually
it became evident to Rita’s friends that one of Rita’s
trials was her husband’s inability to face their position
with a gallant laugh, as she did.</p>

<p>As time went on, and there appeared to be no hope of a
salary for Richard, she sent away the little girl’s nurse.</p>

<p>“I think I ought to be able to manage. Lots of poor
women have to, only it’s a great pity I was brought up to
play the piano, and dance, and play tennis, instead of
learning to cook. One somehow never thought of it’s
being necessary.”</p>

<p>“It oughtn’t to be necessary now,” said Richard
violently, “if you’d married a fellow with money, or brains
enough to make some.”</p>

<p>“Why, I might have been a millionairess, if I’d married
the first man that ever proposed to me,” she said brightly.
“Doesn’t it seem odd?”</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>“D’you know, darling, I saw a really lovely jumper in
Colson’s window to-day. It was real old rose, the colour
that suits me. It was one of the sale things and marked
down to half a guinea. I had a frightful struggle—it is
such ages since I had anything new. I wouldn’t even let
myself go into the shop, though I had to get some things
for baby. I went somewhere else. I felt I couldn’t bear
to come out of Colson’s without that jumper. It was
so lovely—and really marvellously cheap. It’s been
haunting me ever since.”</p>

<p>“Surely we can find half a guinea,” said Richard, his
face flushing.</p>

<p>“Richard!” She gave a little laughing scream. “Why,
I work out every penny of my income on paper before I
spend it, and do you know what’s left over for my clothes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
when I’ve paid the wages and the rent, and rates and
taxes, and the housekeeping books? Just—exactly—five
pounds a year!”</p>

<p>She held up five fingers, laughing.</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe that I once spent five pounds a year,
or thereabouts, on gloves, but I suppose I did. I don’t
really know how I could manage now, if mummie didn’t
still give me so many presents.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with her head on one side, rather like
a very pretty squirrel.</p>

<p>“I do manage rather well, don’t I, dear? I have to
work pretty hard, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course you manage well,” he said ungraciously.
He hardly ever encouraged her with praise nowadays,
although she was doing wonders. He only gave way to
violent outbreaks of despair and self-reproach, when she
assured him that she could do without things that she had
had all her life, and that she wasn’t really so <i>very</i> tired after
two bad nights with the baby.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it lucky I’m so strong?” she sometimes asked
her friends. “I do a lot of the housework myself, you
know, because we can only afford one servant, of course,
and she’s a rough sort of girl. It was so funny at first, I
couldn’t understand that class of servant at all. At home,
of course, the maids were all quite different. Ellen means
very well, really, though I’ve had to learn cooking, so as to
do a certain amount myself. Will you forgive me now, if
I run to see that Richard’s supper is all right—not burning?”</p>

<p>She tripped away, still laughing, in spite of the tired lines
that were beginning to show beneath her sparkling dark
eyes.</p>

<p>“Rita is too wonderful, poor darling!” said Lady
Clyde. “As she says herself, she’s never in her life been
used to poverty. And look at the way she makes the best
of things! You know they’re living on her tiny little income,
that she manages too wonderfully for words. You
can’t say <i>now</i>, Charles, as I remember you once did, that
Rita, of all people, wasn’t fitted to take the risk of poverty.”</p>

<p>Whether Sir Charles could, or could not, have repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
his axiom, was not destined to be made clear, for he said
nothing at all.</p>

<p>He did, however, make many attempts to find a job for
Richard, and went to see the originator of the phrase that
described Richard’s wife so well—“a gallant little lady”—who
was connected with some highly-remunerative business.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m on the point of retiring, Sir Charles. Times are
bad, though I’ve made my pile, but it was done by hard work
at one job all my life. I’ll see if there’s anything for your—stepson,
is it?”</p>

<p>“He is no relation of mine,” said Sir Charles very distinctly.
“He married my wife’s only daughter by her
first husband. He is now obliged to live upon her—very
small—fortune.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard something of that. Poor little lady—she’s
doing wonders, I hear. Well, well, I’ll see if they’ve anything
to offer the lad, but we don’t want men without experience
these days, you know. But I’d like to do something,
for the sake of that gallant little lady.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>

<p>“Richard dear, I <i>would</i> like to ask mummie and Sir
Charles to dinner—supper, I mean—one night. I’ve got a
little cash in hand, so I shouldn’t feel too extravagant. You
know I got rather more than I expected, for the sale of that
old bracelet of mine.”</p>

<p>Richard did know, because Rita had told him this already,
quite gleefully, although admitting that the bracelet had
been a legacy from a specially beloved grandmother, and
that it cost her a pang to let it go.</p>

<p>“I loathe your selling your jewellery. It makes me feel
such a cad for having got you into this mess, though God
knows I never foresaw anything like this. Rita, <i>must</i>
you do these things?”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a face of piteous, childlike surprise.
“Oh, aren’t you <i>at all</i> pleased that we’ve got an
extra pound or two, Richard? I’m sure you’ve no idea
what a difference it makes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>He groaned impatiently.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you think I’ve no right to suggest entertaining
<i>any</i>body, even on a tiny scale, now we’re so poor,
I won’t do it. It was silly of me, I daresay, but I haven’t
really properly got used not to having an occasional little
party, I suppose. It’s all right, Richard darling. Never
mind.”</p>

<p>She smiled bravely.</p>

<p>“Rita, I shall go mad if I can’t find a job, and take you
out of this sort of thing,” said Richard, and he began to
pace up and down the little room.</p>

<p>When Lady Clyde and her husband did come to dinner,
Rita told her mother privately that poor darling Richard
was becoming almost hysterical sometimes. It did make
things so much, much harder when one was doing all one
could to keep up under the strain, and be always bright
and ready to make the best of it.</p>

<p>“No one can say you’re not doing that, my dearest child,”
said her mother.</p>

<p>Tears of mingled admiration and compassion rose to her
eyes when Rita apologised gaily for the poverty of the
fare, when she corrected herself every time that she mentioned
the word dinner instead of supper, and when she
laughingly excused herself for having to run away and help
with the washing-up, because the servant now was only a
daily one, and went home early.</p>

<p>“It seemed so funny at first, mummy, and I was always
ringing the bell and expecting it to be answered, like when
I used to ring for Cooper or Ellis or Mary, at home. I really
can’t believe that I had a maid all for myself, just to do my
hair and keep my clothes tidy, not so very long ago.”</p>

<p>“What a plucky little thing she is!” said her mother in
a choked voice.</p>

<p>She glanced resentfully at Richard, who sat silent,
moody and haggard, without endorsing her tribute to his
wife in any way.</p>

<p>He looked very ill, but Lady Clyde at the moment
could only realise to what straits he had brought Rita, and
with what surly unresponsiveness he seemed to confront
her courageous acceptance of poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>Lady Clyde asked her husband that night if he could not,
as man to man, give Richard Lambourne a hint that his
ungracious attitude to his wife, whilst living on her money,
was the final crown of the wrongs that he had done her.</p>

<p>“I was going to suggest, personally, that you should
give Rita a hint,” said Sir Charles.</p>

<p>“Rita! Why, when I think of that poor child’s gallantry——”</p>

<p>“Exactly. My own impression is that a very little more
of it will drive Lambourne into a mad-house, or worse.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles spoke in his usual level accents, and Lady
Clyde did not attempt to attach any meaning to his words.
Neither did they recur to her when Richard Lambourne
disproved her assertion that he had placed the crown upon
the wrongs done to his wife, by the final ignominy of
suicide.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Coward, coward!” sobbed Lady Clyde. “Can you
deny that he was a coward, Charles?”</p>

<p>“No. Richard was a coward,” said Sir Charles gravely.</p>

<p>“After all that poor little Rita had done!”</p>

<p>“And said,” added Sir Charles, not flippantly, and half
under his breath.</p>

<p>The old magnate who had admired Rita at her wedding
made use of almost the same words as Lady Clyde.</p>

<p>“After all that his wife had done, and was doing, to quit
like that, and leave her to face the life he’d brought her
to! What a <i>brute</i>!”</p>

<p>A little while afterwards he proposed to Rita, diffident,
in spite of his wealth, because of the great difference in
their ages.</p>

<p>She accepted him, and this time it was Sir Charles, looking
at the bridegroom’s bald head and infirm gait beside the
pretty bride at the quiet wedding, who repeated to himself
the old man’s catchword, with an ironical emphasis of his
own:</p>

<p>“A <i>very</i> gallant little lady.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE HOTEL CHILD</h2>

<p class="ph1">(<span class="smcap">To Y. de la P.</span>)</p>
</div>

<h3 class="nobreak">I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first time that I saw her was in Rome. I was
governess to the children at the British Embassy, and
every morning before breakfast I took them out into the
Borghese Gardens.</p>

<p>They were very good, insignificant little children, and
never gave me any trouble. Whilst they played tame little
games between the grey-green olive trees, I used to watch
the more amusing Italian children in the Gardens, the
biggest groups consisting of pupils from the great white
Convento dell’ Assunzione, on the corner of the Pincio.</p>

<p>But the little girl in whom I took the greatest interest
was always by herself. An enormous grey limousine would
leave her at the entrance to the Gardens, and fetch her away
again at the end of an hour. Sometimes the limousine,
which was always empty except for a liveried chauffeur,
appeared to have forgotten her, and then I was obliged to
take my children away, leaving her serious and solitary, and
quite undisconcerted, sitting on her bench. I judged
her to be about eight years old, and the child of rich people.
Her white embroidered dresses, far too elaborate, were
expensive, and she always wore white shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>At first, her nationality puzzled me. Her quite straight
hair was black, cropped short round her beautifully shaped
little head in a fashion that was then very unusual, and her
lashes were as long and as black as those of any Roman-born
child. But her grave eyes were of a deep grey, and
her skin, fine and colourless. Perhaps she was scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
pretty, but her poise, her erect gracefulness, above all, her
unmistakable air of breeding, made her remarkable. It
was that air of aristocracy that made me feel sure that, in
spite of her independence, she was not American. One gets
to know, after seven years spent in the best families.
The American children are well-drilled, well-dressed, well-behaved—sometimes—but
they never achieve that look of
distinction. Some of the French ones have it, but then
those are the children of the old Catholic families, and so
they are poor, and generally badly dressed. On the whole,
it is to be seen amongst the English as often as anywhere—and
then, it is almost always accompanied by the expression
that denotes, to an experienced governess, either stupidity
or adenoids—and sometimes, indeed, both.</p>

<p>My little aristocrat of the Borghese Gardens spoke
Italian perfectly. I heard her greet the chauffeur when he
came for her, and those were the times when she was most
childlike. The man very often let her take the wheel,
after he had started the car, and I used to watch, not
without misgivings, the great car sliding away, with the
small erect figure in the driving-seat, her straight black
fringe blowing back from her forehead, her tiny hands
gripping the big wheel.</p>

<p>My charges, it need hardly be said, might never speak to
strange children, but one day the unknown little girl
restored to me a toy that one of them had dropped the day
before.</p>

<p>“I found it, after you’d gone,” she said very politely and
distinctly.</p>

<p>I knew then that she must be English, at least in part.</p>

<p>My children were playing at a distance, and after thanking
her for returning the plaything, I sat down on the stone
bench that she had made her own.</p>

<p>After an instant’s hesitation, she sat down there, too.</p>

<p>We entered into conversation.</p>

<p>I asked whether she lived in Rome.</p>

<p>“No. My papa is here on business for a little while,
and then we are going to Paris again.”</p>

<p>“Your home is in Paris, then?”</p>

<p>She looked rather puzzled. “I don’t know Paris well,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
she observed apologetically. “We were only there once
before, when mama was with us. It was a nice hotel, I
thought, but noisy. This one—the Grand—is better.
Have you been much in Paris?”</p>

<p>“Not since I was at school there. My French was acquired
in Paris,” I added, automatically.</p>

<p>One says that kind of thing so often, to please the
parents.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle aime parler francais, hein?” she enquired,
with a little smile.</p>

<p>Her French was as perfect as her Italian, or her English;
and it was evidently natural to her to speak either language.</p>

<p>“Are you English?” I could not refrain from asking her.</p>

<p>“My papa is Italian—mama was half English, and half
French.”</p>

<p>Was? Then her mother must be dead. That would
account for the empty limousine, and the strange independence
of the child.</p>

<p>“Mama is in New York, now, we think,” she remarked.
“I am to join her when I am ten; that was arranged for,
in the deed of separation.”</p>

<p>“Separation?” said I.</p>

<p>“There is no divorce in Italy,” said the little creature,
shrugging her shoulders. “Papa is a Catholic, though not,
of course <i>pratiquant</i>. They have been separated since I
was seven.”</p>

<p>“Then who—who——” I wanted to ask who looked after
her, but such a form of words seemed singularly inappropriate.
“Who looks after your papa’s house?” I found
at last.</p>

<p>“We are in hotels, most of the time, papa and I, and
my maid, Carlotta, but in the holidays—<i>les grandes vacances</i>—we
go to the country somewhere—<i>villegiatura</i>—and there
is a lady then, always.”</p>

<p>Her grave eyes looked at me. “A different one,” she
explained, “each time.”</p>

<p>Her very complete understanding of the status held by
the “ladies” was implicit in her manner, but that struck
me less poignantly than did her philosophical acceptance
of all that they stood for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>The grey limousine came into sight, and she made an
amiable little sign to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“I must go now. It doesn’t <i>do</i> to keep the <i>auto</i> waiting.”</p>

<p>In her grave little voice, was all the circumspection of
the child that has learnt to fend for itself, that knows by
experience that it will only be tolerated so long as it gives
no trouble, runs counter to no prejudices, is guilty of no
indiscretions.</p>

<p>“It has been so pleasant to talk to someone English.
Good-bye Miss——?”</p>

<p>Her little pause was exactly that of a grown-up person,
before an unknown or unremembered name. And what
precocity of discernment had told her that “Miss” was
the suitable prefix?</p>

<p>“Miss Arbell,” said I. “Tell me your name before
you go.”</p>

<p>“Laura di san Marzano.”</p>

<p>She pronounced Laura in the Italian way—<i>Lah-o-ra</i>.</p>

<p>When I held out my hand, she kissed it, as Italian children
do, and after she had climbed to the driving-seat, she waved
to me, before turning the grey car down the hill.</p>

<p>I looked for her every morning after that, but she never
came to the Borghese Gardens again.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>

<p>The second time that I saw Laura di san Marzano was
nearly four years afterwards, in the hall of the Majestic
Hotel, at Lucerne.</p>

<p>I had thought of her, at intervals, and had no difficulty
in recognising her, in spite of the difference between eight
years old and twelve.</p>

<p>She was tall and very slim, and the set of her dark head
on her straight shoulders was just the same. Her black
hair now fell in a long plait to her waist, but she still wore
the straight, short fringe that suited her du Maurier profile.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon—tea-time, and the hall was full
of people, and noisy.</p>

<p>Laura sat motionless, but somehow, one felt, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
attentive, beside a beautifully-gowned and jewelled and
painted woman, who was talking to half a dozen men.</p>

<p>Mama?</p>

<p>She looked very young to have a child of Laura’s age.</p>

<p>Then I saw that Laura’s green silk frock was absurdly
short, and made in a babyish style, that matched the huge
bow of green satin ribbon unnecessarily fastened over one
ear.</p>

<p>My pupil, a nearly grown-up one, was late, and as I waited
for her, I watched Laura.</p>

<p>Presently our eyes met. At once recognition leapt into
hers, and she smiled at me, and bowed.</p>

<p>I returned the salutation—with infinitely less grace, as
I knew in my middle-class British self-consciousness—and
wondered whether she would come and speak to me.</p>

<p>Later on she did so, when the group round mama was at
its noisiest.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Miss Arbell?” There was not the
faintest hesitation over my name. “I used to see you
often in the Borghese Gardens, in Rome, and once we talked
together. I hope you remember?”</p>

<p>“I remember very well,” said I, “but I am surprised at
your doing so. You were so very young then, and you must
have met so many people since.”</p>

<p>“I never forget people,” said Laura simply.</p>

<p>“You left Rome suddenly, didn’t you?” I continued.
“I was there for nearly a month after our meeting, but I
never saw you in the gardens again.”</p>

<p>Laura shook her head slightly.</p>

<p>“I can’t remember,” she admitted. “Very likely we
left suddenly. One does that so often. The management
of the hotel becomes intolerable, or tiresome acquaintances
appear—and then the simplest thing is to pack up and go
elsewhere.”</p>

<p>She spoke so evidently from experience that one could
but accept her strange, rootless, attitude as part of her
natural equipment.</p>

<p>We talked for a little while, and she told me, or I deduced,
that since the Roman days she had been a great deal in
Paris—(“I adore the Opera there, but the theatres not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
much”)—and then in New York, with mama. She was to
spend the next few years with mama.</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p>Laura’s shoulders indicated the faintest of shrugs.
Anywhere. Mama liked New York as well as most places,
but personally Laura thought that the rooms in the hotels
there were always too hot. They went to London a good
deal. Delightful—she smiled at me politely—but one
missed the sunshine. Her point of view, inevitably, was
one of great sophistication. It did not, to my mind, detract
from her charm, which had never been of a direct,
childlike kind, but rather of a description so subtle that
amongst the many it might easily pass for mere oddity.</p>

<p>“I hope we shall meet again,” she said to me, when a
certain nervous movement in the group of mama’s admirers
had culminated in the detachment of a tall, fair youth, who
was coming now towards Laura herself.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that I leave here to-morrow. My pupil and
I are on our way to rejoin her parents in Italy.”</p>

<p>“We may be gone ourselves to-morrow. I meant for
later on—any time, anywhere.” She smiled charmingly,
but her unchildlike eyes remained serious and rather
weary.</p>

<p>I heard the fair youth say something to her, with a burst
of meaningless laughter. She did not laugh in return,
but her clear, well-bred little voice was raised to a
sympathetic tone of interest.</p>

<p>“Mama likes an olive in hers, always, but for me I prefer
a sweet Martini—with <i>two</i> cherries, if you please.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I saw Laura twice again before leaving Lucerne, but we
did not speak to one another.</p>

<p>The first time, at seven o’clock the evening of that same
day, was in one of the gigantic hotel corridors, on the first
floor, where I was waiting for the lift that was to take me
to the fifth.</p>

<p>The hotel hairdresser, in a white coat, with an immense
head of curled and discoloured yellow hair, stood before a
shut bedroom door. It flew open suddenly, and then closed
sharply behind Laura di san Marzano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“Vous voila donc! Eh bien, il est trop tard.”</p>

<p>Her voice was ice, her face scornful and unbelieving as
she listened to the man’s torrent of excuses for his tardiness.</p>

<p>“Assez,” said Laura. “Madame est fort mécontente.
Elle ne veut plus de vous.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle——”</p>

<p>“C’est inutile. Madame se passera de vous.”</p>

<p>And as the hairdresser turned away, grumbling and
disconcerted, she added superbly:</p>

<p>“J’arrangerai la chose. Soyez exacte demain. Mais
pour ce soir, c’est moi qui coifferai madame.”</p>

<p>Much later in the evening, when I had long ago despatched
my pupil to the bedroom opening out of mine, I
returned for a moment to the hot and strident lounge in
order to make certain enquiries at the office.</p>

<p>Mama was in a white wicker armchair, with crimson and
orange cushions overflowing upon either side of it, and
showing up the elaborate waves of her hair, as black as
Laura’s own. The paint that I had seen on her face earlier
in the day was now concentrated into one scarlet curve
upon her mouth, her white lace dress was held up by narrow
black velvet straps cutting across the opulent creaminess of
her shoulders, and the electric light above her head had
fastened upon the diamond butterfly bows of her satin
shoes, so that they winked and flashed right across the hall.</p>

<p>One hardly saw—certainly did not distinguish—the
figures that composed her numerous entourage, but the
prevailing black and whiteness, the glitter of continually
raised small glasses, gave a general impression of unrelieved
masculinity.</p>

<p>Laura sat beside her mother, on an upright chair. She
was dressed in rose colour, a frock even shorter than the
green one that I had seen before. Her straight hair had
been somehow persuaded into a semblance of long curls;
the green silk bow over her left ear had been replaced by a
pink one with fringed ends.</p>

<p>She did not see me. Her eyes, indeed, were glazed with
fatigue, and every now and then her head fell forwards and
was jerked upwards again.</p>

<p>The hall was unendurably hot with a breathless, artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
heat, and the orchestra was playing an American rag-time
that every now and then succeeded in out-sounding the
medley of raised voices and high-pitched laughter and
clinking glasses.</p>

<p>It was long after eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>As I looked at Laura, I saw that her slim, silk-clad legs
were swinging gently to and fro between the bars of the
high-backed chair. Her feet, in bronze-coloured dancing
slippers, could not quite reach the floor.</p>

<p>For the first time, I saw her as the child she really was—the
efficient, helpless, cosmopolitan, traditionless, hotel child.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>

<p>It is a far cry from the family of a British Ambassador—collectively
distinguished, if individually dull—and the
blue wonders of Italy, to an English Girls’ School and the
grey horrors of an east coast town.</p>

<p>The post that I filled temporarily at Lundeen School
was not one that I should have considered, but for personal
and family reasons of convenience. They are long
since past, and matter nothing to the story.</p>

<p>But it was at Lundeen School that I saw Laura di san
Marzano for the third and last time.</p>

<p>It was the most inappropriate setting imaginable.</p>

<p>She was left there by mama, in mid-term, because a
continental doctor had declared that she needed bracing air
and companionship of her own age, and also—this I learnt
later, quite incidentally, from Laura herself—because mama
and a <i>cher ami</i> had suddenly planned a visit to Monte Carlo
for the express purpose of visiting the Casino, to which Laura,
being under twenty-one, could not have been admitted.</p>

<p>Laura, as the hotel child, had been pathetic, but her
dignity had been safeguarded, if not actually enhanced,
by the kaleidescopic background of her surroundings.</p>

<p>At school, she was pitiful—and out of place. The girls,
without ill nature, despised her from the first.</p>

<p>She arrived amongst them in the short, fanciful, ultra-picturesque
silk frocks and infantile bows of hair ribbon
that I had seen her wear abroad. Those unimaginative,
untravelled English schoolgirls had seen no one like her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
before, and what they did not know, by experience or by
tradition, they distrusted and disliked.</p>

<p>Lundeen School made demands upon the pupils’
<i>physiques</i>, upon their powers of conformity, and upon each
one’s capacity for assimilating wholesale a universally
applied system.</p>

<p>Laura di san Marzano had no chance at all.</p>

<p>The child who “never forgot people” could not remember
her multiplication table, and although she spoke perfectly
at least three languages besides English, she had never
learnt syntax, nor read a line of any history. She had seen
the Guitrys play in Paris—(and from her crisp appreciations
and criticisms I deduced that no finest <i>nuance</i> of their art had
been lost upon her)—but she had memorized no standard selections
from the poets. And she did not know how to learn.</p>

<p>No one, not even the head mistress, was very much disturbed
by Laura’s educational deficiencies, because it was
so evident from the first that her stay amongst us would
only be a very temporary affair.</p>

<p>Mama would certainly swoop down again, probably
without warning, and resume Laura as suddenly as she had
discarded her.</p>

<p>That was how mama always did things, one felt sure.</p>

<p>Laura herself, although evidently aware of her shortcomings,
accepted them with a grave, but unexaggerated,
regret. She seemed, quite without arrogance, to know that,
even educationally, there were other standards than those
of Lundeen, and that her connection with these latter was
after all merely transitory.</p>

<p>What really distressed her, and shocked her too, I think,
was the attitude of the other girls.</p>

<p>Compared with the hotel child, there was only one word
that adequately described these daughters of so many
excellent English homes—and that word was <i>uncivilised</i>.</p>

<p>They played unbeautiful games violently, they spoke in
hideous slang, they were rudest when they intended to be
most friendly.</p>

<p>Towards Laura di san Marzano, indeed, they did not wish
nor attempt to display friendliness. They were simply
contemptuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>And I saw that the hotel child minded that, both from
pride and from ultra-developed social instinct.</p>

<p>My work was entirely amongst the elder girls, and I saw
very little of Laura during her brief stay, but towards the
end of it, something happened. The rumour arose and
spread like wild-fire, even to reaching the Common Room of
the teaching staff, that Laura di san Marzano was in
disgrace with her fellows for cheating over an examination
paper.</p>

<p>The tradition of Lundeen was that of the public-school
code. Cribbing was permissible: ‘copying’ or peeping
at the questions set for an examination, was impossible.</p>

<p>They were already prejudiced against her; the accusation
was accepted on the instant by her contemporaries.</p>

<p>The Prefectorial system was in full force at Lundeen, and
in any case, I could not have made the affair my business.
But it so happened that I was present when Laura uttered
what I believe to have been her one and only specific denial
of the charge against her. I came unexpectedly into the
room, and saw the semi-circle of self-righteous inexpressive,
young faces that confronted Laura, who stood, rather pale
and with her head held proudly high, and spoke very softly
and clearly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t cheat. Those who thought they saw me, made
a mistake. You are being very unjust and cruel, all of
you.”</p>

<p>She was looking the head of her class straight in the eyes
as she spoke, and the girl, giving her back look for look,
made a sound that unmistakably expressed contemptuous
incredulity.</p>

<p>“What is all this?” said I sharply.</p>

<p>They were taken aback, all of them. There was an
instant of confused silence, and it was, after all, only the
hotel child who possessed enough of <i>savoir faire</i> to reply to
me.</p>

<p>“Miss Arbell,” she said courteously, “it was a—a
necessary conversation. It is over now.”</p>

<p>She crossed the length of the room, very composedly,
and went out quietly.</p>

<p>Her ostracism, after that, was complete. It lasted for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
week, and then, just as one had always surmised would
happen, mama, in sables and violets, drove up in a blue
Lanchester car, and said that she and Laura (who looked so
much stronger and better for the change) would at once
go straight to Paris, give themselves enough time to find
some clothes, and sail for New York the following week.</p>

<p>The hotel child, her face radiant, came to find me and
say good-bye to me. She was incapable, for all mama’s
imperious haste, of forgetting or omitting the courtesy.</p>

<p>“Do you actually leave this evening?” I asked her.</p>

<p>Mama had been even more impetuous than I had
anticipated.</p>

<p>“Yes. I need never see any of <i>them</i> again.”</p>

<p>“It has been an experience, at least,” I reminded her.</p>

<p>“Yes—but——” she shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Expensively bought?” I suggested. And, since she was
leaving, I thought that I might add: “At least, my dear,
you have kept your colours flying. These last days have
been very trying, I am afraid, but you come out of them
better than our friends of the Fourth Form, to my thinking.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Laura. She looked at me with her
grave, straightforward eyes.</p>

<p>“It would have been much easier, though, if only I really
<i>hadn’t</i> cheated.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is a postscript to the story of the hotel child. A
very few years later I heard of her marriage to the Prince
d’Armaillh’ac-Ambry, the representative of the noblest,
and one of the wealthiest, of French families. I believe
that they live almost entirely on his estates in Brittany,
and that the Princess interests herself personally in the
numerous peasantry around them.</p>

<p>Her two children, a boy and a girl, are brought up in
great simplicity, and to the strictest and most orthodox
Catholicism.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span>, three, five Dedicated Virgins. They stood before
their Reverend Mother, ponderous black folds of serge
sweeping the boards round each flat-soled pair of black list
slippers.</p>

<p>“The orphans must go to the dentist,” said Reverend
Mother, mournfully, yet with determination. “Here we
are in a Protestant country. We must adapt ourselves
to the conditions of our exile. The orphans will have
to be taken to the dentist’s house.”</p>

<p>The nuns looked at one another, and at Reverend
Mother, and solemnly nodded.</p>

<p>It was an innovation, but if Reverend Mother said so, it
must be right.</p>

<p>“Sister Clara and Sister Dominic, you will take three
orphans to the dentist to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Sister Clara drew herself up a little. Her throat swelled
beneath the white swathings that bound her head and neck,
and her double chin momentarily became three.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother dear,” she said proudly.</p>

<p>Her Irish voice was rich and deep, compared with the
thin, nasal tones of the Frenchwomen.</p>

<p>“Shall I order a cab for them, Mother?”</p>

<p>That was Sister Caroline, the <i>sœur econome</i>.</p>

<p>“No, no. They must walk ... holy poverty....
You will put on the heavy travelling veils, Sisters, and the
big cloaks, just the same as for a journey.”</p>

<p>The heat of that would be stifling, in this weather and
on foot! An unmortified thought.... Sister Clara stuck
a pin in her sleeve. She would remember to confess a
slight yielding to sensuality of thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>There had been similar yieldings, once or twice, within
the last year.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother dear. Sister Dominic’ll sit in the waiting-room
with two of the dear orphans, and I’ll be looking after
the one that’s in with the dentist. I’ll not take an eye off
of her, on any pretext whatever. I quite understand,
Mother dear, that’s the way it’ll be. Make your mind
easy.”</p>

<p>One had to be knowing, and careful, going out into the
world.</p>

<p>There was a sense of adventure in setting out, the
additional veil hanging swart, and straight, and heavy,
pulling a little so that one’s head jerked slightly backwards
every now and then.</p>

<p>Sister Dominic held a stout umbrella in one black-cotton-gloved
hand, whilst the other one grasped the wrist of the
youngest orphan. The other two orphans, obscured in
blue serge and hard, dark, straw hat-brims, each held on
to a fold of Sister Clara’s habit.</p>

<p>One thing, Reverend Mother had promised that the
community should recite the Litany of Loretto after office
just as they did to ensure anyone from the convent a safe
journey.</p>

<p>So they’d be protected, even scurrying, a row of five,
holding on to one another, across the streets, in front of
those frightful honking motor-cars, that looked like they’d
take the heads off of you, give them a chance.</p>

<p>“This’ll be it, Dominic dear. No. 3.”</p>

<p>A maid in a cap and apron to open the door—and the
smartness of her! All grey-and-white, and showing her
shape the way a modest convent-bred girl would never
have done.</p>

<p>And the waiting-room, with a carpet, and padded chairs,
and a fine pot-plant—putting worldly ideas into the orphans’
heads, as likely as not. As for the pictures and books on
the table....</p>

<p>“Don’t be casting your eyes about that way, children
dear. Sit quiet now. Dominic, the hats’ll have to come off
of them, we may be sure of that. We’ll pile them this way,
on the chair, and you’ll keep an eye on them, for fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
someone else’ll be coming in and perhaps making off with
them. It’s not as though we were in a good Catholic
country.”</p>

<p>The hats of the orphans were stacked upon a chair, and
Sister Dominic sat upon the edge of another chair, facing
them. She held her umbrella.</p>

<p>“If he does well by the children, the sisters’ll go to him.
The Infirmarian says there’s some of them with teeth in
a terrible state.”</p>

<p>Sister Clara’s tongue sought familiar cavities, and her
hand went to the particular fold of serge sleeve in which
were imbedded two large pins, one of which was taken out
at the end of meals, and replaced after use in the exact same
place, so as to save making a fresh hole.</p>

<p>“If you’ll step this way, Sister——”</p>

<p>Mother of Mercy! What a start she’d got! It was the
man himself, and smiling, too, standing holding the door
open. Awfully young-looking, with dark eyes that might
have been Irish, and a queer white coat on him.</p>

<p>And the gentleness of him, when he’d got the orphan into
that chair of his! She’d only to stir, and him stopping
the machine, and saying, with that smile, that he was afraid
it was hurting her.</p>

<p>As if one didn’t go to the dentist to be hurt, and the
pain to be offered up for all Reverend Mother’s intentions!</p>

<p>Look at the hands of him!</p>

<p>She watched them, moving softly and skilfully. Presently
he talked to her, at first friendly, joking, little
questions, then at more length, telling about himself. He
was a stranger in the town, too.</p>

<p>“It’ll be the grand thing for you, if Reverend Mother
sends the orphans regularly. I’ll put in a good word for
you,” she ventured, and he looked at her, screwing-up his
eyes, and laughing.</p>

<p>She’d not spoken to any man, not counting the good
holy priests which was a different thing altogether, for
many years.</p>

<p>But if they were all like this, where would be the harm
in them at all? She’d make the orphans start a novena
for his conversion to the Faith, that very night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Now the next child, please.”</p>

<p>He spent half an hour on each orphan, and the last one,
he said, would have to come again.</p>

<p>“I’ll be bringing her along.”</p>

<p>He entered the appointment in a little book.</p>

<p>“I’ve no secretary, you see, Sister—can’t afford one
yet!” and then he shook hands with her. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The feel of his hand was just what she’d imagined it’d be,
gentle, and yet strong. There were funny little dark hairs
all down the back of it and along the wrist. And although
it was such a hot day, the palm of him was cool and dry.</p>

<p>Sister Dominic spoke to her, humbly, on the way home.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a wonderful woman of the world, Sister
Clara dear, getting us all safe there and back and talking
to the man just as though it was the gardener at dear old
Noisy-le-Grand. It won’t be so hard, next time, if Reverend
Mother sends us again.”</p>

<p>Reverend Mother did send them again, with relays of
orphans, and then Sister Clara alone, with old Mother
Seraphina who spoke no English and whose cheap <i>râtelier</i>
appeared to need endless adjustments.</p>

<p>And he was always kind, and he always smiled, with that
screwing-up of his eyes, and talked to Sister Clara.</p>

<p>One day she said that she had toothache, and received
Reverend Mother’s leave to make an appointment for
herself after Mother Seraphina’s session. She had, for
days, been devoured by an intense curiosity to know what
it would feel like to have those hands hovering about one’s
face. Once, he had had to put his arm right round the
back of Mother Seraphina’s old head....</p>

<p>“No, it’s not hurting me at all, at all.” She smiled up
at him; a smile that she felt to be beatific, half-hypnotised.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see what I’ve been doing?”</p>

<p>“I would.”</p>

<p>“There—on the left—that big molar——”</p>

<p>He put a little mirror into her hands. And she that
hadn’t looked in a glass, hardly, since the day of her final
vows, twelve years ago!</p>

<p>Gracious, what a colour she had! Plum-colour, that
was her face. And the smile that had felt beatific, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
foolish and uncertain, as though she were ashamed of something.
The glass turned dim as her heavy breathing struck
it.</p>

<p>Would she perhaps have been breathing into his face
that way all the time, and she never thinking of such a
thing?</p>

<p>The face in the glass looked redder than ever. Mother
of Mercy, this weather! The heat of it! And the holy
habit no less than five smelly thicknesses of serge, and
not wearing thin yet, though on the back of her year in
and year out.</p>

<p>“That’s the last stopping, Sister. I shan’t have to
trouble you again.”</p>

<p>“Amn’t I to come to you any more then?”</p>

<p>“It won’t be necessary. What I’ve done should last
you for a long while. But if you have pain, come to me at
once. Any time.”</p>

<p>What’d it be like, at all, not seeing him any more?
Could it be that she’d become inordinately attached, the
way the Imitation said was so wrong? And to a man,
too.</p>

<p>She was a wicked creature, not worthy of the holy
vocation.</p>

<p>“Is there nothing more needs doing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all. You have excellent teeth, Sister.
There’ll be no more trouble, now those fillings are in.”</p>

<p>The smile he gave her! So that one hardly heard what
he was saying....</p>

<p>“If the Reverend Mother wants anyone else seen to, I
shall be very pleased to do what I can. Good-bye, Sister.
I should like to have persuaded you that there’s plenty of
good work to be done outside, too. Take a capable woman
like yourself, now. It seems a shame you should be shutting
yourself up inside four walls. Why, you—you might
have been my secretary, if I could only afford to have one!”</p>

<p>That was a grand laugh of his, it made one want to laugh
too, only that one might start crying somehow.</p>

<p>It seemed there’d be nothing left to look forward to in
the whole world after the shake of the hand meaning
good-bye. There was still that....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>It was the queer way to feel entirely, and her forty years
old.</p>

<p>Touching the hand of him for the last time, and it strong
and yet gentle at one and the same time, quite different
to the hand of any woman....</p>

<p>It was over now, and one hurried away, scared that old
Seraphina’d see something strange in the face of one.</p>

<p>“Will any more of the sisters be going to him, Mother
Seraphina?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nor any of the dear children?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mother of Mercy, there was no sleeping in this heat!
But it wasn’t the heat. It was the way one was fretting
and crying after what couldn’t be. Though what for
couldn’t it be, when he’d said himself that it was a sin
and a shame for the like of her to be shut up inside four
walls, and himself wanting a secretary and not able to pay
one? There’d be some glad enough to work for him without
any pay.</p>

<p>Day after day it went on, and night after night, till the
pain in one’s head was past bearing, and still there was no
getting to sleep.</p>

<p>The things one thought of!</p>

<p>There was the door, giving right on to the street, and then
only a bit of a walk, and oneself knowing every step of the
way, and then the sight of him, and the feel of those hands
of his—it was that would put everything right, and take the
spell off of one.</p>

<p>On the hottest night of all, Sister Clara made up her
mind. She’d break her holy vows, that were already broken
in the heart of her, and go back into the world.</p>

<p>In the morning she dressed and went downstairs.</p>

<p>She’d not be taking anything with her. After Mass the
nuns’d be going to the refectory, and they’d not be missing
her for awhile, and they keeping the custody of the eyes the
way the Holy Rule enjoined.</p>

<p>Oh, it was the fine nun she was, to talk about the Holy
Rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>The door was unlocked. Once outside on the pavement,
there was nothing to do but pull it to again.</p>

<p>The slam of it!</p>

<p>There’d be no getting in again now, without a great
ringing of the bell, and the portress coming to answer it,
and the giving of scandal to the whole of them.</p>

<p>If it hadn’t been for that slam of the door....</p>

<p>The weather had broken. It wasn’t hot any more, but
raw and chilly.</p>

<p>The way he’d laugh, and look at you, so interested in any
little thing you said! It was wonderful.</p>

<p>What time did people in the world get up and start their
day? Later than this, no doubt. But there’d be the
waiting-room, where she’d sat with Sister Dominic and the
orphans that first time of all. (Maybe she’d never set
eyes on Dominic again.)</p>

<p>What for did that maid of his take so long to come to
the door?</p>

<p>But it wasn’t the maid who opened the door at last.</p>

<p>It was a person in a blue apron, with a man’s cap pulled
down over her eyes, and her sleeves rolled up, and a bucket
with a mop in it at her down-at-heel feet.</p>

<p>“’E ain’t come yet. Won’t be ’ere, not for a hower,
but if it’s the toothache, you can come in and wait.”</p>

<p>“Does he not live here, then?”</p>

<p>“Ho no,’e don’t live ’ere. But ’e comes reg’lar, and
’e’ll be along by-and-by. You go in and sit down. You
won’t mind me going on with the cleaning-up? Turned
cold all of a sudden, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>The rolled-back carpet in the waiting-room, the chairs
piled, seat against seat, round the walls, the broom that
presently chased into all the corners, made it seem colder.</p>

<p>It grew colder and colder as the hour went by.</p>

<p>That was the sound of a key in the lock outside.</p>

<p>“’Morning, Mrs. Hatch. A nasty change in the weather,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mumble, mumble, mumble.</p>

<p>“Oh Lord, already!”</p>

<p>He came into the room where Sister Clara shuddered and
cowered inside her folds of enveloping black serge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>Look at the face of him! Different, somehow.</p>

<p>You could see how he felt the sudden chilliness in the air,
and he was rubbing his hands together, hard. They were
different, too—all mottled with cold.</p>

<p>“You in pain, Sister?”</p>

<p>“I—I’ve come.”</p>

<p>“M’m? I don’t attend to anyone till nine o’clock, you
know, as a rule, but if it’s a question of pain.... Well,
what can I do for you? By the look of you, it’s an abscess,
isn’t it?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE APPEAL</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> isn’t a story. It’s an attempt at reconstruction.
Given my knowledge of the principals—Mary Jarvis, and
her mother, Mrs. St. Luth—I think I can do it.</p>

<p>Mary Jarvis was my mother, and Mrs. St. Luth, of
course, my grandmother. Thank god, I’m a modern and
can look at them impersonally—judge each on her own
merits, as it were.</p>

<p>My mother and my grandmother made scenes as other
women make jumpers. It was their form of self-expression.
I imagine—although I never knew for certain—that it was
my father’s inability to maintain himself <i>à la hauteur</i>, in
the perennial melodrama that was my mother’s idea of
life, that led to my grandmother being invited to live with
them.</p>

<p>She came when I, their only child, had barely reached
the stage of exchanging my baby frills for first knickerbockers.
(I am certain, although I don’t remember it,
that my mother wept and said she felt that she had lost
her baby for ever.)</p>

<p>Already my parents were unhappy together. Mary—I
call her so here for convenience, but she would never
have tolerated it in reality—Mary, although really affectionate
and impressionable, was fundamentally insincere,
with herself and with everybody else. She lived entirely
on the emotional plane, and when genuine emotions were
not forthcoming she faked them by instinct. Her mother,
who belonged to the same type, although with more strength
of character, and far less capacity for affection, had always
played up to her. They had their violent disputes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
violent reconciliations—neither could have been happy
without—but they did respect one another’s poses.</p>

<p>But my father never played up.</p>

<p>He couldn’t. Worse still, if he could have done so, he
wouldn’t—on principle.</p>

<p>Again I can’t remember, but I can imagine, almost to
the point of certainty, short and searing passages between
my parents.</p>

<p>“Robert, I want you not to ask me to play the piano
to-night.”</p>

<p>(He so seldom gave her an opening, that she had to force
them.)</p>

<p>“Off colour?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that. I heard to-day that Mrs. Thorndyke’s
child is dead. It—it upset me.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t know the child.”</p>

<p>“I know Katherine Thorndyke.”</p>

<p>“You’ve met her once or twice, I remember. And
didn’t we hear that if the poor child had lived, it must have
been an idiot?”</p>

<p>Probably, at that stage, my mother burst into tears.
She’d been heading for that, of course, although she didn’t
know it consciously. But my father did, and had made her
aware that he did, in a rather brutal fashion.</p>

<p>That was the way they reacted on one another.</p>

<p>It was better, after grandmother came. Curiously
enough, my father liked her, although she and Mary had so
many of the same characteristics. But I think he regarded
her as a sort of lightning conductor.</p>

<p>For Mary herself, however, it was different. Like so
many people who manufacture continual unhappiness for
themselves, she had a frantic craving for happiness, and an
irrational conviction that happiness was her due.</p>

<p>She told me herself, long afterwards, that she never had
any thought of infidelity towards my father, nor did she ever
meet any man who could or would have caused her to
break her marriage vows. But—and this she didn’t tell
me, it’s part of the reconstruction—she was constantly
obsessed by a vague and romantic expectation of some such
encounter. I imagine that she could not believe the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
to have been created without a special application to her
yearnings.</p>

<p>And then undoubtedly the nervous wear and tear that
she imposed upon herself, and upon us all, told on her
spirits. Her scenes with grandmother, although they may
have served as a safety-valve, were too frequent. They
may also have served to throw into painful contrast her
husband’s stolid opposition to any form of emotional
stimulus.</p>

<p>However that may be, grandmother had formed part of
our household for rather less than a year, when Mary
suddenly ran away.</p>

<p>It was, I suppose, the only dramatic thing that she could
think of, in a wet and dreary February, and I have no
doubt at all that she did it on impulse. That is to say, she
gave herself time to write an immensely long letter to my
father—in which perhaps she set forth that view of herself
which he never gave her adequate opportunity for putting
into words—but she gave herself no time to pack up her
things. She simply took her dressing-case, and I am sure
that that was mostly filled with photographs in folding
frames, and packets of letters tied up with ribbon, and
little manuals of devotion heavily underscored in several
places.</p>

<p>Then she walked out of the house, and to the station, and
eventually got to Assisi. And they traced her there almost
at once, partly because she took no pains to cover up her
tracks, and partly because my grandmother—who understood
the processes of her mind—found a copy of a Life of
St. Francis on the drawing-room sofa, face downwards,
with one page all blistered, as though tears had fallen upon
it.</p>

<p>My father, for his part, found the long letter that no
doubt told him how little he had understood a sensitive
nature, and possibly to what point their life together had
become intolerable.</p>

<p>And this had the strange effect of making him resolve,
and declare aloud, that nothing would induce him to try
and get her back again. There must have been a stormy
scene between him and my grandmother, who had all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
conventionally moral instincts of her day, and was genuinely
shocked and disturbed at her daughter’s abrupt and violent
casting off of her obvious responsibilities.</p>

<p>“For the child’s sake, at least, Robert ...” she must
have repeated many times.</p>

<p>(Neither she nor my mother ever understood the futility
of repeating, again and again, words which had already
failed of their appeal.)</p>

<p>“A child whose mother can leave him, at four years old,
is better without her.”</p>

<p>“It was madness, Robert, but you know she’s not a
wicked woman—my poor Mary. If you go and bring her
back now, no one will ever know what has happened, and
you can start a new life together, and try again.”</p>

<p>“It would be useless.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t say that.” The tears must have been
pouring down her old face by that time. “Oh, Robert,
give her another chance. This will have been a lesson
to her—won’t you forgive her and take her back?”</p>

<p>Well, in the end she prevailed to a certain extent—that
is to say, my father would not seek out the culprit himself,
but he would allow grandmother to do so, and if she
brought Mary home again properly repentant he would
not refuse to receive her and give her the “chance” of
starting their married life afresh. “For the boy’s sake.”</p>

<p>My grandmother must have repeated that phrase a
hundred times at least, and it was certainly her <i>pièce de
resistance</i> in the scene at Assisi with Mary.</p>

<p>I’ve had a version of that scene from each one of them,
and on the whole the accounts tally, although of course
each viewed it—as they viewed everything—exclusively
from the personal angle.</p>

<p>My mother saw only a young, beautiful, misunderstood
woman, goaded to frenzy in the grip of an uncongenial
marriage, taking a desperate step in search of freedom.
And then, even stronger and more touching in her relinquishment,
finding the courage, for love of her child, to
return to the house of bondage.</p>

<p>And my grandmother, with equal inevitability, saw only
a sorrow-worn woman, no longer young (but infinitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
interesting), courageously undertaking a solitary journey,
on a mission that should restore sanctity to a shattered
home. And even as her urgent plea had shaken Robert’s
defences, so her eloquence, her boundless influence and
unfaltering understanding, must prevail with the slighter,
more trivial personality of her daughter. The achievement
of persuading Mary to return to her husband and child
was, my grandmother told me, the ultimate justification of
her existence, in her own eyes.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I doubt if she, any more than the
rest of us, felt her existence to be in any need of justification
whatsoever—but she was addicted to phrases, and
this one at least served as an indication to the magnitude
of her effort.</p>

<p>For Mary did not capitulate without a struggle. And
it is in the details of that struggle that my reconstruction
work comes in, for although each of the protagonists has
quoted to me whole sentences, and even speeches, of
brilliant oratory from herself and inadequate rejoinder
from the other, I do not believe either of them. Accuracy,
with that type, can never co-exist with emotion—and
emotion, real or imaginary, is never absent.</p>

<p>But this, I imagine, is more or less what took place in
the sitting-room of the tiny <i>albergo</i> at Assisi:</p>

<p>“I’ve come to fetch you home, my child. You shall
never hear one word of reproach—Robert only wants to
begin again—a new life.”</p>

<p>“Never, mother. It’s impossible. I’ve borne too
much. I can’t ever go back to it. I must live my own life.”</p>

<p>(Probably Mary had been reading <i>The Doll’s House</i>.
People were discovering Ibsen in those days.)</p>

<p>“Mary, it’s not five years since you and Robert were
married, in the little country church at home, by our dear
old vicar, who held you at the font when I took you, a
tiny baby, to be christened.”</p>

<p>It may have been at this stage that Mary began to cry.
Anyway, I’m certain that my grandmother did. Any
allusions, however irrelevant, to little country churches at
home, and Mary as a tiny baby, were always apt to bring
the tears to her eyes—and I’m sure that neither of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
had thought for an instant of steadying their nerves by
sitting down to a solid meal. So that tears must have
been easier, even, than usual.</p>

<p>“Robert doesn’t understand me—he never will.”</p>

<p>“Darling, don’t you remember your early days together?
The little things—little jokes, and allusions, and happinesses
shared together? Does one ever forget?”</p>

<p>“<i>No.</i>”</p>

<p>Mary sobbed. “But I can’t go back to him.”</p>

<p>I think that here, if my grandmother gave her a chance,
she probably did make one—or part of one—of the speeches
that she long afterwards quoted to me.</p>

<p>She was intensely unhappy. Robert did not understand
her, and she could not live in an unsympathetic
atmosphere. She should go mad. All that she had ever
asked of life was peace, beautiful surroundings, and the
ideal companion.... If she went back to Robert now,
after having found courage to make the break, it would
be a repetition of the misery that had broken her heart during
the past three years.</p>

<p>(The hearts of my mother and grandmother both suffered
innumerable breakages throughout their lives, neither of
them ever seeming aware of the physiological absurdity
of the expression.)</p>

<p>“It’s braver to stay away than to go back and try and
patch up something that can never be anything but a
failure,” quavered Mary, with a momentary flash of insight.</p>

<p>But of course grandmother couldn’t leave it at that.
She had the justification of her own existence to think of,
for one thing. I am quite sure that a fortuitous street-musician,
rendering “Santa Lucia” or “Silver Threads
Amongst the Gold” in the distance, would have broken
down Mary’s frail barrier of honest thought, and have
materially assisted my grandmother to her victory. Accessories
were so absolutely essentials, to them both.</p>

<p>But so far as I know, grandmother had to win on points,
as it were, and received no extraneous help in the shape
of sentimental appeals from without.</p>

<p>She made her supreme effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“For the boy’s sake, Mary ... your little, little boy.
Is he to be motherless?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t Robert let me have him?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear. How could he? I myself—the mother
that bore you, Mary—I couldn’t think it right that a woman
who had deliberately deserted her husband and home
should have the care of a little, innocent child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my baby!”</p>

<p>She sobbed and cried, but she had not yet capitulated.
Grandmother, however, had gauged pretty accurately the
force of the baby-<i>motif</i>.</p>

<p>“Before I came away, on my long, lonely journey,” she
said slowly, “I went up to the nursery, to say good-bye to
Bobbie. He had on his blue overall—the one you embroidered
for him last summer, Mary—was it only last
summer?—and he was playing with his engine, on the
nursery floor, his dear, round face was so solemn....”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t—don’t——”</p>

<p>But grandmother, the tears streaming from her eyes,
relentlessly continued: “Darling, his big blue eyes looked
up at me, and his little voice asked: ‘<i>Where’s Mummie?</i>’”</p>

<p>Did grandmother’s—even grandmother’s—conscience
misgive her, at the quotation? That it was verbally
correct, I have no doubt—but what of the intonation?</p>

<p>My grandmother’s poignant rendering of “<i>Where’s
Mummie?</i>” no doubt contained all the pathetic appeal of
bewildered and deserted childhood throughout the ages....</p>

<p>But mine—the original “<i>Where’s Mummie?</i>...” I have
no recollection of it, of course, but I do remember myself
at four years old—a stolid, rather cynical child, utterly
independent by temperament, and reacting strongly even
then against a perpetually emotional atmosphere. And one
knows the way in which small children utter those conventional
enquiries which they unconsciously know to be
expected of them ... the soft, impersonal indifference of
the tone, the immediate re-absorption, without waiting for
a reply, in the engrossing occupation of the moment....</p>

<p>Mary held out for a little while longer, but the heart
went out of her resistance after the pitiful sound of that
“<i>Where’s Mummie?</i>” as my grandmother rendered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>She gave in “for the boy’s sake.”</p>

<p>And my grandmother had justified her existence.</p>

<p>They travelled home together, and Mary averted anti-climax
by quite a real nervous breakdown, that overtook
her after she got home, before my father had had time to
forgive her in so many words.</p>

<p>So they began again—literally.</p>

<p>It wasn’t, in fact, possible for them to be happy together,
and they never were so. I grew up in the midst of scenes,
tears, and intermittent periods of reconciliation. There
was no stability about my childhood; and no reality.
Undoubtedly I was the victim—far more so than my father,
who presently sought and found consolation elsewhere, or
than Mary, whom he thus provided with a perfectly legitimate
grievance that lasted her until he died, fifteen years
later. After that, she was able gradually to forget that
there had ever been unhappiness between them, and to
assume the identity of a heart-broken widow.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Luth, my grandmother, lived to be very old.</p>

<p>“But useless old woman though I am, God gave me the
opportunity of justifying my existence, when He let me
bring a mother home to her little child....”</p>

<p>I wonder.</p>

<p><i>A committee-room on the top floor of a house in a
small provincial town. Back of the stage, centre, there
is a door, opening inwards on to the stage. To the right
of the door, a few pegs are on the wall for hanging coats,
etc. Right of the stage, is a good-sized window, showing
distant views of chimney-pots outside. Left of the stage,
a small gas-fire burns. Near it, a table and chairs have
been formally arranged for the meeting.</i></p>

<p><i>The whole atmosphere of the room is cold and dreary.
Time: a winter afternoon in 1917.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Miller discovered. She is cold and tired-looking,
mechanically arranging blotting-paper, etc. on the table.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ballantyne enters. She is prosperous-looking
and clad in warm furs, and is out of breath from ascending
the stairs.</i></p>

<hr class="tiny2">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span>: Good afternoon, Mrs. Ballantyne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span> (<i>out of breath</i>): Good afternoon. Oh
dear, those stairs! I’m out of
breath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span>: They are trying, aren’t they?
Four flights!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: Oh, you oughtn’t to find them
trying, at your age. Tell me,
have you any idea why we’ve all
been asked to come here to-day,
Miss Miller? It’s not the day
for our regular meeting, at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span>: No, I’ve got the notice for that
all ready to send out as usual.
This is a special meeting that Mrs.
Lloyd-Evans is calling. She only
sent me a note about it last night,
telling me to get the room ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: She wrote to me too, but she
didn’t say what it was all about.
I suppose she’ll have written to
Mrs. Akers, as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span>: Here they are.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Mrs. Lloyd-Evans and
Mrs. Akers. Mrs. Lloyd-Evans is
mysterious and melancholy, and
Mrs. Akers lively and full of undisguised
curiosity. Both wear
heavy coats, furs, etc. They shake
hands with Mrs. Ballantyne, and
nod and say how d’ye do to Miss
Miller. Whilst they talk they
loosen or take off their wraps, and
place them on the pegs near the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span> (<i>to Mrs. Ballantyne</i>): How d’ye do.
We’re all a little before our time,
I think, but then as I always say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
it’s better to be too early than too
late. (<i>This she says with an air
of originality.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: Of course, the minute I got your
note I quite saw that something
must have happened, or you
wouldn’t have asked us to come
out in this dreadful cold, <i>and</i> up
those awful stairs. I do think,
when we’re doing the whole of
this Welfare Committee business
gratuitously, that they might have
found us a room on the ground
floor. Isn’t there any hope of
getting better premises?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: They pretend that any accommodation
is difficult to find nowadays,
but I should like to know why
some building shouldn’t be done?
What I always say is, that there
wouldn’t be half this unemployment
trouble, if people were given
<i>work</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span> (<i>bored</i>): Yes, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: It’s just Bolshevism, you know,
all this talk of unemployment.
There’s always work for those
who are willing to work. Now I
can’t help thinking it would
put a stop to all this labour unrest,
if they could only send a few of the
leaders to <i>Russia</i>, to show them
what Bolshevism has resulted in,
there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballantyne: Yes, of course. It really would
be a lesson. (<i>She is arranging
her dress, etc., as she speaks, and
tidying herself at a little pocket-mirror.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span> (<i>seating herself, to Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</i>): Well, I’m
all agog to know what’s happened.
Your note was most mysterious.
What’s been happening at the
School? Really, the present
generation is the limit—always
giving trouble. It seems to have
come in with bobbed hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Girls are often very artful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Well, we ought to be able to cope
with the artfulness of mere schoolgirls,
surely. Now do let’s sit
down and get to business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span> (<i>to Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</i>): As you see,
I haven’t brought my daughter.
I’m sure it was very thoughtful
of you to warn me in your note,
but I gather it means that we have
something—painful—to discuss?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: One hardly likes to put things
into words—but your Phyllis is a
young girl, after all, and I always
feel there ought to be something
<i>sacred</i> about a young girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: I had to pretend to Phyllis that
you wanted to speak about some
very dull question of finance. It
was deceiving her, perhaps, but I
<i>do</i> so agree with you about how
one ought to treat young girls as
something <i>sacred</i>, as you say.
So I told her the whole thing was
going to be very formal, and only
members of the actual Committee
allowed to be present. I’m afraid
it was rather in the nature of a
pious fraud.</p>

<p>(<i>They all laugh, and draw slightly
closer together</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Before we begin, I should like
to say that this must all be in
absolute confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span> (<i>looking at Miss Miller</i>): Excuse me
a moment. (<i>She whispers to Mrs.
Lloyd-Evans. The other ladies
try to hear what is said, and at
the same time to look as though
they were doing nothing of the sort.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span> (<i>aloud</i>): I am sure Miss Miller will be
discreet. Charity sometimes forces
one to face very painful things, and
one must be brave and hear about
various tragedies that one would
far prefer never to mention at all.
(<i>Pause.</i>) One hardly knows how
to word certain things. (<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: Really, if it’s anything of <i>that</i>
sort, I think we ought to ask Miss
Miller to leave us. (<i>Aside</i>): she’s
only a girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span> (<i>eagerly</i>): <i>That</i> sort? What sort?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: Well, you know what I mean.
But I’m sure I hope I’m mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: I’m afraid you’re not, Mrs. Ballantyne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Call a spade a spade. Is it the
usual thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: I should be sorry to call it the
<i>usual</i> thing. But I’m afraid that’s
what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: I’ve worked in a district, and
my husband has a large medical
practice amongst poor people.
I suppose some girl has got into
trouble?</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. Lloyd-Evans bows her head
in assent, and once more all three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
ladies draw their chairs closer together.
Miss Miller covers her face
with her hands for a moment.</i>) <i>From
now onwards, the three ladies are
all much more animated, and full
of barely-disguised enjoyment of a
subject which they all regard as a
delicate one.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: We’re all married women here,
and I think we can discuss this
better without Miss Miller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span> (<i>quickly, and with suppressed agitation</i>): If
it’s a formal meeting, you’ll want
the minutes entered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Yes. She’d better stay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span> (<i>aside to Mrs. Akers</i>): I don’t agree.
I’m the mother of a girl myself,
as you know, and to me girlhood
is <i>sacred</i>. We have a most painful
subject to discuss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller:</span> Please let me stay. I—I might
help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: How could <i>you</i> help, Miss Miller?
And even if you could, it would be
most unsuitable in an unmarried
girl like yourself. Please wait in
the next room until we call you to
take down the results of the
conference.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit Miss Miller, and shuts the
door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: I don’t know that I altogether
like that girl. Rather horrid of
her to be so curious, wasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: Any young woman with a <i>nice</i>
mind would have been only too
thankful to be spared the embarrassment
of staying in the room while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
such a thing was being discussed.
(<i>Her tone changes to eagerness.</i>)
Well, this is too dreadful! Which
of the girls is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: I’m certain it’s one of those
twins! They really are pretty—you
know what I mean, pretty <i>for</i>
that class. Which of them is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: It’s nothing to do with the twins.
(Though I daresay it’ll be them
next—one never knows, when
once this sort of thing begins.)
No, it’s the girl from London, the
daughter of that widowed Mrs.
Smith who has been taking in
washing in West Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Fanny!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: That child! But she can’t be
more than sixteen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Fifteen. But one knows what
London girls are, at any age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: How did you find out? Is it
absolutely certain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Absolutely. It ought to have
been found out months ago, if
the girl hadn’t been so artful.
Even her mother says she had no
idea, till just the other day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span> (<i>decidedly</i>): That’s impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: She pitched a long yarn about
the girl herself not having known
what was happening. They pretend
it came to light by accident,
through something Fanny said to
her mother, which made her
suspicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span> (<i>eagerly</i>): What was that? If we’re to
help at all, we’d better know
everything.</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. Lloyd-Evans whispers to
her, and Mrs. Akers whispers in
her turn to Mrs. Ballantyne.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: And when do they expect——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: In three months’ time, actually.</p>

<p>(<i>The members of the Committee,
in silence, make rapid movements
upon their fingers, in evident calculation.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Then it must have happened
after they got down here, that’s
clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: I think it’s much more likely
it was in London. There’d just
be time. Londoners are always
immoral. Besides, as I said to her,
<i>in our town these things don’t
happen</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: How did they take it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: The girl herself seems absolutely
callous. I couldn’t get a word out
of her. The mother says she
hasn’t been able to, either, and
she’s been trying to force her to
tell her when it happened. The
grandmother was there, as well,
and you know what an odious old
woman <i>she</i> is. I shouldn’t be at
all surprised if she’d been in the
plot the whole time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: When did all this conversation
take place, if I may ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Only yesterday. I happened
to go in there, and found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
mother in tears, so of course I got
the whole story out of her. I
felt it was a question for the
Welfare Committee—married
women, like ourselves—and I’ve
done absolutely nothing, except
ask Dr. Akers to see the girl and
make certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Well! He’s never said a word
to <i>me</i> about it. I must say, he
was out late last night and early
this morning, but I do think he
ought to have given me a hint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Gentlemen are so odd, about
anything to do with their business.
I’ve often noticed it. One
has to probe for <i>hours</i>, sometimes,
to get the simplest piece of information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Look here, we shall have to
settle something. Of course the
girl must go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Others</span>: Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: The question is, where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: Surely some Sisterhood would
take her in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: One doesn’t want to be hard on
her. I told the mother that we
should discuss it all quietly
amongst ourselves before settling
anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: <i>I</i> think we ought to send for the
girl, and see if we can get anything
out of her. Of course, it would be
very trying and dreadful, but I’m
sure that’s what we ought to do.
I, for one, shouldn’t shrink from
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: You wouldn’t get a word out of
her. They were all in league
together, it seemed to me.
Thoroughly artful and determined
to stick together, I thought them,
all three of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: I can’t see why the grandmother
should have any say in the matter
at all. Pray what has <i>she</i> to do
with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: She talked a great deal of nonsense
about wanting to keep
Fanny at home. As I said to her,
if keeping Fanny at home results
in <i>this</i> sort of thing, then the
sooner Fanny goes away from home
the better. She was thoroughly
nonplussed at that, as you may
imagine, and couldn’t answer anything
at all, though of course she
chattered away, but I took not the
slightest notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: But, Mrs. Lloyd-Evans, do you
mean to say that they won’t tell
who the man is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: The girl won’t say a word. As I
said to her myself, it <i>must</i> have
been somebody in London before
they came away, and it’s no use
telling me it happened here, because
I simply shan’t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Well, what about a Home, or
some other place where the girl
could go till it’s all over? It had
better be as far away from here
as possible, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The other two as before</span>: Oh, of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: I have two or three addresses
of that kind—one place is near
London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: The very thing. I’d gladly
take her up myself, if necessary.
She’s very young and one doesn’t
want to be hard on her. What
line are the mother and grandmother
taking up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: The mother cried a good deal,
and said how ashamed she was
that the girl should make such
a return for all that’s been done
for them down here. People have
been very kind about employing
her—I’ve sent washing there myself.
(She charges less than the
steam-laundry.) She was thoroughly
upset, and one could have
managed <i>her</i> all right. It’s the
grandmother that’s so impossible,
and the girl looks as though she
could be thoroughly obstinate.
I’m bound to say she was looking
very ill, so one didn’t want to
frighten her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Well, that doesn’t apply to the
old woman. She must be squashed.
Leave the grandmother to me if
necessary. If there’s any difficulty
about their letting Fanny
go, I can say we shall inform the
police. These people are perfectly
ignorant of the law, and would
probably believe anything. (<i>She
laughs in a slightly shamefaced,
way.</i>) After all, it’s for the girl’s
own good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: Certainly, and besides, for their
own sake they want to avoid
exposure. The mother can be
told that the Committee is taking
the whole expense and trouble off
her hands, and she’ll be only too
thankful to let the girl go. She
can come back when it’s all over,
and if they’re careful, people
needn’t know anything about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: But what will happen—when——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: What will be done with the—with
the little——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: The <i>results</i>, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Oh, the baby. In these sad
cases, one almost hopes that it
may not live, dreadful though it
sounds to say such a thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: My husband tells me that in
his experience, illegitimate children
are often particularly strong
and healthy infants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: God’s ways are not our ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span> (<i>to Mrs. Ballantyne</i>): But in this case,
of course, the child will be taken
away the minute it’s born, and
the mother will probably never
set eyes on it at all. It’s taken
to some Institution where they
look after it, and that gives the
mother a chance of living it down.
Especially when she’s so young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: The grandmother said something
about the baby, as she
called it, but of course I stopped
that at once. They can hardly
earn enough to keep themselves,
as it is, and if there was any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
question of Fanny being allowed
to keep the child, it would simply
amount, as I told her, to putting a
premium upon immorality. Of
course, if one knew who the man
was, pressure could be brought to
bear on him, but I don’t believe
for an instant that it’s a case of the
girl having been seduced. She’s
probably a thorough little bad lot.
Quite likely she doesn’t know who
the father is. I’m told that some
of these London girls are frightfully—promiscuous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: I don’t know how to believe
that—at fifteen! I’m afraid it
may have been somebody down
here, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Oh please don’t suggest such a
thing. It’s the last thing we
want to have established. Just
think of the talk! As it is, if we
don’t press the question, we can
get the girl away quietly and
nothing be known about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: You think we shan’t get anything
out of her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Nothing, nor her mother either,
according to her own account.
The old grandmother began some
story about an assault having
perhaps been made on the girl,
and she too frightened to tell;
but as I said, if that sort of thing
was new to her, a girl’s first
impulse would be to rush to her
mother with the story, and if she
didn’t, it only showed that she
thought nothing of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>): I wonder if <i>I</i> could get anything
out of her? I’ve a very
good mind to go home that way.
One dreads having to deal with
this sort of sad case, but after
all, it’s charity. I could put
the old grandmother into her
place once and for all, as you say
she’s disposed to be tiresome, and
make Fanny herself understand
that we only want to help her.
After all, we’ve all read our Bible,
I hope: “Which amongst you
shall cast the first stone?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: As the mother of a girl myself, I
was wondering if <i>I</i> ought not to
talk to Fanny, perhaps. Goodness
knows, it’s a miserable affair,
but the world is what it is,
and it’s no use <i>shrinking</i> from these
things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span> (<i>displeased</i>): As it was I who made
this very sad and perplexing discovery,
I think I had better be the
person to see the business through.
Naturally, one consults the Committee,
but I can’t help feeling
that there had better be only one
intermediary between the Committee
and the girl’s family.
It’s more business-like, and one
must be business-like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: Oh, certainly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: But this isn’t an official meeting,
is it? We’ve had no notes taken,
or anything. And we haven’t
passed any resolution. Now, I
should like to propose that I write
to-night to St. Mary Magdalene’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
Home and try and arrange to get
Fanny taken in there as soon as
possible, and kept till after the
birth of the child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: I second that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Proposed and seconded. Those
in favour—(<i>they each lift up a
hand</i>). Those against.... Carried
unanimously, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Now, is there anything more we
can do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: I don’t think so. If there are
any further developments, I will
let you know, of course. I mean,
if one can get any admission out of
the girl, for instance. She seemed
to me perfectly stolid and bewildered,
but one doesn’t want to risk
upsetting her, naturally. It would
be extremely annoying if anything
happened before we can get
her away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: What did they say about her
health? Is she all right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: Perfectly all right. Why
shouldn’t she be—a young,
healthy girl like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: After all, it’s nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: I don’t call it nature at all,
at fifteen. I call it <i>sin</i>. (<i>Rises,
and goes to put on her coat. The
other two remain seated.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span> (<i>shuddering</i>): Fifteen! Just think
of it! My Phyllis is only two
years older. Thank heaven, I’ve
been able to keep her as innocent
as a baby. She knows
<i>nothing</i>—absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Innocence is such a safeguard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: What I shall tell her about this
meeting, I really don’t know. Unfortunately,
she knew where I
was coming, and I shall have to
invent something to tell her in
case she asks any questions about
it, as she’s certain to do. Luckily,
I think she trusts me absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Come home to tea with me, dear
Mrs. Ballantyne. It will help
to take both our minds off the
whole sad subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: How very kind of you! I should
love to. We must try and forget
all about it for the time being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: I can’t help wondering how
Fanny could have managed to
deceive her mother for so long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: I must say, I should have
thought any woman with eyes in
her head——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Yes, and besides, why didn’t
the girl, if she was a respectable
girl, go <i>straight</i> to her mother
when——</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. Akers and Mrs. Ballantyne,
lean across the table, talking
busily about Fanny’s behaviour,
both at once. Meanwhile Mrs.
Lloyd-Evans, who has now got her
furs on, stands as though listening
to some sound outside the door,
unnoticed by the other two. She
tiptoes rapidly to the door and
flings it open. Miss Miller is
crouching outside, having evidently
been listening. One side of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
face is scarlet where it has been
pressed to the door, the other white.
She rises awkwardly as the door
opens, but not before they have all
seen her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span>: I <i>thought</i> so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span> (<i>wildly</i>): What did you think, Mrs. Lloyd-Evans?
That I’ve been listening
at the door? So I have!
That I’ve overheard all your
charitable plans for Fanny Smith
and her illegitimate child? So I
have!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: You should be ashamed of
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballantyne</span>: What’s the meaning of this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span>: I’ll tell you. You said just now
that the world is what it is—there’s
no use in shrinking from things—shrinking
from them! Ha, ha,
ha! (<i>she laughs hysterically</i>).
You’re a great deal more likely
to jump at them. But if you
want to have my explanation, you
shall have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span> (<i>pointing to the door</i>): Miss Miller,
leave the room.</p>

<p>(<i>Miss Miller looks at her, still
laughing, then turns the key in the
door, shutting and locking it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span>: I shan’t leave the room, nor
you either, till you’ve heard
what I’ve got to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Akers</span>: Good heavens, she’s mad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lloyd-Evans</span> (<i>advancing resolutely</i>): Give me that
key this moment (<i>putting out
her hand for it</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>(<i>Miss Miller, too quick for her,
dashes to the window, throwing up
the sash, and flings out the key.
During the rest of the scene she
stands with her back to the open
window, while the three other
women are grouped together behind
the table, at the further side of the
room.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span> (<i>her voice has grown cunning, and bitterly
and vehemently ironical both at
once. She gives the impression
of dementia</i>): <i>I</i> knew what you
were going to talk about. <i>She</i>
(<i>pointing to Mrs. Akers</i>) gave
it away when she said it must be
“the usual thing.” Of course I
listened, to hear what you’d do
for Fanny—poor Fanny, who’s
going to bring a little baby into
the world, and who’s been ill and
terrified and unhappy, all these
months. And you (<i>to Mrs. Lloyd-Evans,
bitter mockery in her
tone</i>) found it out, and you asked
these other kind, charitable, rich
ladies to come and meet you here,
so that you could all talk it over,
and make plans about Fanny.
(<i>Suddenly and viciously</i>): And oh,
how you all <i>enjoyed</i> it—didn’t you—telling
each other how painful
it was, and how sad, and how you
could hardly put it into words!</p>

<p>(<i>Fiercely</i>): Why, you nearly
scratched one another’s eyes out
for the fun of going to Fanny’s
mother, and “putting the old
grandmother into her place” and
putting Fanny through the Third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Degree, nagging and nagging at her
to <i>tell</i>, so that you could hear more
shocking details, and come and
gloat over them.</p>

<p>(<i>Mimicking</i>): “Oh, but we want
to help her,” and “girlhood is so
<i>sacred</i>.” (<i>To Mrs. Ballantyne</i>):
Yes, you said that several times,
didn’t you, you who are so thankful
that your girl <i>trusts</i> you—so that
when you cheat her and tell little
lies for her own good, the poor
little fool swallows it. She won’t
always swallow it, you know—she’ll
find you out one day. Just
like I’ve found out, what charity
means and what’s done to girls who
sin and get found out. I had to
know, you see, because—I’ve done
what Fanny did——</p>

<p>(<i>The women cry out, below their
breath.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Miller</span>: You needn’t be frightened—it
isn’t anyone down here. That’s
what you’re afraid of, isn’t it—that
it may all end up tamely after
all, with a hasty marriage, and
nothing left to talk about! You’d
like to hustle me away, like Fanny,
to somewhere that will take your
money, and make you feel all nice
and glowing and charitable—and
where they’ll “take away the
baby, and the mother probably
never sets eyes on it at all.” To
be allowed to keep it, would “put
a premium on immorality”
wouldn’t it? Ha, ha, ha! I’ve
been frightened all these weeks,
but I’m not frightened any more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
now. Something went snap inside
my head, I think, all in a minute,
while I was listening to all of you.
I’d thought of appealing to you,
you see—such kind ladies, all
given over to works of charity!
If you’re the <i>charitable</i> (<i>laughing
wildly</i>) what would <i>other</i> people
say? No, no, no—I’ll not be
like Fanny, I’ve thought of a
better plan than any of yours!</p>

<p>(<i>She springs on to the sill of the
open window. Mrs. Akers cries
“Stop her!” and they dash forward,
but the table impedes them,
and Miss Miller, still laughing,
throws herself out.</i></p>

<p><i>The curtain falls as Mrs. Lloyd-Evans,
screaming, pulls at the
locked door, and the other two
women throw themselves against the
window and look downwards.</i>)</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
